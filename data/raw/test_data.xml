'''Neide Núria de Sousa Van-Dúnem Vieira''' (born July 4, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://platinaline.com/index.php/contacto/item/600-entrevista-exclusiva-neide-van-d%C3%BAnem/600-entrevista-exclusiva-neide-van-d%C3%BAnem|title=Entrevista exclusiva – Neide Van-Dúnem|language=Portuguese|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 28, 2016|publisher=Platina Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Neide''', is a popular Angolan contemporary singer, songwriter, and film/television actress. Born and raised in 
[[Luanda, Angola]], Neide started her acting career in local theater in 2003, at the age of 17, being cast in the television soap &quot;Sede de Viver&quot; a year later. Her singing career officially began in 2007 with the release of the hit single &quot;Olá Baby&quot; in the compilation album ''Eu e Elas (vol 1)'', a song for which the video reached the number two spot on the [[MTV Africa]] Video Chart.

== Early life ==
Neide was born on July 4, 1986, in [[Luanda]], [[Angola]] and is the [[only child]] of José António Vieira and Isabel Maria de Fátima Sousa Van-Dúnem, although she has three half-brothers and six half-sisters. Neide's interest in music came at a very early age although it was as an actress at age 17 that she would have her first encounter with fame. But she eventually broke into the music scene in 2007 with the release of the hit single &quot;Olá Baby&quot;.

== Recording career ==

=== 2006–2007: ''Olá Baby'' ===
In collaboration with producer Caló Pascoal, Neide's initial venture into the music business came in the form of a duet with the producer on the song &quot;Olá Baby&quot;, the lead single of the compilation album ''Eu e Elas (vol 1)'' released on April 29, 2007. The song's commercial success launched Neide's singing career and established her as a &quot;double threat&quot; in the entertainment business (singing and acting).

===2008–2009: ''Teu Marido Casou/Esta Noite''===
Neide decided to put her acting career on hold to venture forth as an independent artist and started working on her debut solo album, writing all of its tracks. The music styles she employed were primarily [[Kizomba]] and [[Semba]] but the influence of [[R&amp;B]] is strong. &quot;Teu Marido Casou (com outra)&quot; was the first song to get radio play, to be later released as a CD single along with the song &quot;Esta Noite&quot;. The full album was scheduled to be released in the second half of 2009 but its release was postponed.

So it is true that there were differences in orientation between the two, but they were not as incompatible as they were said to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iwakiri-p43&quot;/&gt; 

However, Iwai subsequently admitted on a TV program that she and Takai did not get along well.&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt; She mentioned that since they were in different groups, they spent little time together and had no conversations with each other outside of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ore&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Igarashi |editor-first=Takao |date=1987-07-01 |title=楽屋交遊録 |trans-title=Back stage friendship |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|Deluxe Magazine|[[:ja:DELUXEマガジン|Ore]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |issue=July 1987 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwai felt that Takai was privileged by Akimoto, which was also not amusing to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kanai |first=Satoru |date=1996-04-03 |title=おニャン子の10年 |trans-title=The Decade of Onyanko |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|Takarajima|[[:ja:宝島 (雑誌)|宝島]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Takarajimasha]] |issue=April 3, 1996 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwai made a curt comment about the successive marriages of Takai and Ruriko Nagata ([[:ja:永田ルリ子|永田ルリ子]], Nagata Ruriko), saying that they should not have rushed into marriage since they were only 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Yasui |editor-first=Makoto |date=1988-08-01 |title=アイドルベストナイン |trans-title=Idol Best 9 |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|BOMB|[[:ja:BOMB|BOMB]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Gakken]] |issue=August 1988 |pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that [[Eri Nitta]], one of the most popular members of Onyanko Club, considered Takai to be one of her best friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Akasaka |editor-first=Shigeru |date=1986-11-01 |title=映画に連れてってくれる彼氏募集してまーすっ!! |trans-title=I'm looking for a boyfriend to take me to the movies!! |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|DUNK|[[:ja:DUNK (雑誌)|DUNK]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Shūeisha]] |issue=November 1986 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Takai herself recalled that when she was in Onyanko Club, there were no members she was particularly close to, and she was frequently alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ore&quot;/&gt;

== Takai's characteristics and Yasushi Akimoto ==
Many of Takai's fans interpreted her sudden marriage as Akimoto forcibly taking her away from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ino-p37&quot;/&gt; Although they directed their uncontrollable anger toward Akimoto, sometimes even directly harassing him, they accepted this fact over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ino-p37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1986, she was secretly being stalked by the [[paparazzi]] of the photo magazine [[Friday (magazine)|Friday]], which was brought to her attention by one of her most enthusiastic fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasai|Akimoto|1986|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also stalked by Akimoto when she and Aki Kihara went to see the movie [[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]] at midnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;kasai-akimoto-p29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasai|Akimoto|1986|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bomb-p41&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|bomb|1986|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, Akimoto approached Takai at the movie theater, feigning coincidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;kasai-akimoto-p29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bomb-p41&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, actress Yuki Saitō, who admits to being Takai's close friend, In her collection of essays, {{nihongo|''About people whom I like''|私の好きなあの人のコト|watashi no Sukina Anohitonokoto}}, she claimed that, contrary to popular perception, Takai was in fact actively courting Akimoto.&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt; He wrote many lyrics for the members of Onyanko Club, but only one song was written for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asuneta2&quot;/&gt;

In addition, when Akimoto talked with her in the summer of 1986, he made the following comments about her.&lt;ref name=&quot;bomb-p4748&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|bomb|1986|p=47-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;She is naive because she was nurtured by the warm love of her family. Such characteristics of hers make her very clean image stand out in the greasy entertainment industry. While [[Sonoko Kawai]] and Eri Nitta will definitely have affairs, she will never commit adultery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bomb-p4748&quot;/&gt; In July 1985, when the members of Onyanko Club stayed at a hotel near {{nihongo|Oiso Long Beach|[[:ja:大磯ロングビーチ|大磯ロングビーチ]]}} in [[Ōiso]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], While all of them excitedly watched the [[pornographic film|pornographic videos]], the &quot;pure-hearted&quot; Takai was the only one who was shocked into silence by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasai|Akimoto|1986|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Akasaka |editor-first=Shigeru |date=1986-03-01 |title=顔よりも性格重視 |trans-title=More concerned with pesonalities than looks |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|DUNK|[[:ja:DUNK (雑誌)|DUNK]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Shūeisha]] |issue=March 1986 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Igarashi |editor-first=Takao |date=1986-09-01 |title=おニャン子㊙ ぶっちゃけ新事実 |trans-title=Onyanko Secrets: New facts without reservation |language=ja |magazine={{nihongo|Deluxe Magazine|[[:ja:DELUXEマガジン|Ore]]}} |location=[[Tokyo, Japan]] |publisher=[[Kōdansha]] |issue=September 1986 |pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was considered by the members of Onyanko Club to be the most feminine of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasai|Akimoto|1986|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her plain, unassuming, ordinary manner was described as her greatest appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ino-p37&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, Akimoto and others described her as having an awkward and quirky side, despite her calm outward appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|sakama|1987|p=51,70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renee Godfrey''' (born '''Renee Vera Haal'''; September 1, 1919 – May 24, 1964) was an American stage and motion picture actress and singer.

==Early life==
Godfrey was born September 1, 1919, in New York, with Dutch and French ancestry&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot; /&gt; as the daughter of Emil Haall, a Dutch diamond merchant, and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=John|title=In Hollywood|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20165304/renee_godfrey/|work=The Times|date=January 25, 1945|location=Indiana, Munster|page=6|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Beginning at age 11, she worked as a model, and as a sophomore in high school she switched to night classes so that she could model during the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; She posed for artist [[John La Gatta]] and photographers [[Edward Steichen]], [[Victor Keppler]], John Hutchins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Renee Haal Posed for $10 an Hour WITH Her Clothes|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20165515/renee_godfrey/|work=The Des Moines Register|date=November 2, 1941|location=Iowa, Des Moines|page=Magazine - 3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. She appeared in advertisements that were published nationally, and she had the most-photographed hands and legs in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perfect Model for 1942|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20166138/renee_godfrey/|work=The Minneapolis Star|date=December 21, 1941|location=Minnesota, Minneapolis|page=Magazine - 5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a film executive saw her image on a billboard, that led the way to her work in motion pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot; /&gt;

Godfrey was featured on both radio and television programs in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One from London|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20167799/renee_godfrey/|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=October 3, 1943|location=California, Los Angeles|page=50|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially entered films at [[RKO]], working as '''Renee Haal''', and made her début in [[Sam Wood]]'s ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940). Also in 1940, she was selected by RKO as that studio's actress most likely to succeed in a film career.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Harold|title='Infant Stars of 1941' Named by Movie Studios|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20166519/hartford_courant/|work=Hartford Courant|date=October 6, 1940|location=Connecticut, Hartford|page=59|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her next movie, ''[[Unexpected Uncle]]'' (1941), was directed by Peter Godfrey, who also directed her in the romantic thriller [[Highways by Night]] in 1942.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Her work in ''Unexpected Uncle'' resulted in her signing a long-term contract with RKO early in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sign Renee Haal|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20167244/renee_godfrey/|work=The Times|date=January 25, 1942|location=Indiana, Munster|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began working as Renee Godfrey in ''[[Up in Arms (film)|Up in Arms]]'' (1944).

During World War II, she and her husband entertained troops with amateur [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] shows that they put on through the [[USO]]. She continued working in small roles, such as Vivian Vedder in ''[[Terror by Night]]'' (1946), in which she sported a particularly unconvincing English accent, and Mrs. Stebbins in [[Stanley Kramer|Stanley Kramer's]] ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''. She worked into the 1960s, appearing in ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]'' and ''[[Tender Is the Night (film)|Tender Is the Night]]''.

For the most part, however, Godfrey was out of view. Her director-husband, who had flourished on 50s TV, was in ill health by the end of the decade. Taking secretarial and real estate classes to help support the family income, Godfrey tried making a comeback of sorts, finding bit roles in the films. She was also a [[Guest appearance|guest player]] on such shows as ''[[Perry Mason (1957 TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Wagon Train]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1938, she went to [[London]] for a singing engagement and met the actor/director/screenwriter [[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} whom she married on August 6, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Renee Haal Wed to Film Director|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20167003/renee_godfrey/|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=August 7, 1941|location=California, Los Angeles|page=30|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was almost 20 years her senior.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} With primary focus on raising her three children (which included a set of twins), she was seen only sporadically on TV during the 1950s with guest roles on programs hosted by [[Loretta Young]] and [[Jane Wyman]].

==Death==
She died in Los Angeles, California, on 24 May 1964 from the effects of [[cancer]]. She was 44 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actor's Wife|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20167973/renee_godfrey/|work=The Town Talk|date=May 26, 1964|location=Louisiana, Alexandria|page=15|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 17, 2018}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final performance in the film, ''[[Those Calloways]]'' was released posthumously.

'''Saba Anglana''' (born November 17, 1970) is a [[Somali people|Somali]]-Italian actress and international singer.

==Biography==
Saba was born in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of [[Somalia]], during the country's [[Somali Democratic Republic|socialist period]]. Her mother was the daughter of an exiled Somali living in neighboring [[Ethiopia]]. Her father was a former commander in the [[Italian Armed Forces|Italian military]], who relocated to Somalia from Italy after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjtlr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Mitch|title=Saba – Jidka (The Line) Review|url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/68072/Saba---Jidka-%28The-Line%29-Review.htm|publisher=411mania|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Saba's father's senior martial background with the erstwhile colonial administration, he was regarded by Somalia's then military regime as a possible spy. The Anglanas were subsequently exiled to Italy, when she was still a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjtlr&quot;/&gt;

Saba was thereafter raised in Italy, where she later studied at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]] in Rome. Her Somali roots, however, remained an important focus. She studied the [[Somali language]] with her mother, particularly the regional dialect of ''Xamar Weyne'', connecting with Somalia through music. Saba is a Muslim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjtlr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;short strory on BBC Amharic website written about Saba on August 17/2, 019. https://www.bbc.com/amharic/news-49069302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Saba began her artistic career in the 1990s as an actress on Italian television. In a popular local TV series entitled ''La Squadra'', she played a policewoman of dual Somali-Italian heritage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXezSlbp68o Video &quot;La Squadra&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Saba released her first studio album entitled ''Jidka: The Line'', in which she mixes the traditional sounds of her native Somalia with contemporary Italian flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18487119 Audio of &quot;Jidka&quot; song&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glenn Stetson''' (November 12, 1940 – August 22, 2003) was a Canadian singer, concert promoter and television producer. Glenn Campbell Stetson was born in the [[Ottawa Valley]] (Ramsayville) of eastern [[Ontario]] and raised in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. He was a lead singer with [[The Diamonds]], whose hits included &quot;[[The Stroll (song)|The Stroll]]&quot;, &quot;[[Silhouettes]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Little Darlin']]&quot;, from the late 1960s through the 1990s.  He studied theater under Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and appeared in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of &quot;[[H.M.S Pinafore]]&quot; and &quot;[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, he was a featured performer for [[Fred Waring]] and the Pennsylvanians. He toured Vietnam in 1966 with the USO. In 1968, he joined the Diamonds and helped keep their name and music alive through the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, particularly on oldies tours and TV. [[The Diamonds]] toured Australia heavily in the 1970s with Australian rock-n-roll legend [[Lonnie Lee]].  Stetson released a solo album in the 1970s entitled &quot;Stetson Country&quot; that was produced by Wayne Jackson of the famed [[Memphis Horns]].  He and the Diamonds were frequent guests on [[Nashville Now]] with host [[Ralph Emery]].

Stetson and Richard J. &quot;Dick&quot; Milano were founders of Little Darlin's Rock n’ Roll Palace in [[Kissimmee]], Florida (opened in 1986, closed in 1992) which was a highly popular [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-area venue in the 1980s. He was co-executive producer for &quot;Live at the Palace&quot; (hosted by [[Wolfman Jack]]) on the Nashville Network (TNN).  &quot;Little Darlin's Rock-n-Roll Palace&quot; and associated oldies tours revived the careers of many performers, notably Fabian, [[Dee Clark]], [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]], [[The Shirelles]], [[Danny &amp; the Juniors]], and [[The Tokens]]. He was also active in charitable fund-raising and civic organisations such as the [[Shriners]] of which he was an honorary member.

Stetson received a heart transplant in 2000 as a result of [[myocarditis]].  However, his health began to deteriorate and he died undergoing an operation on August 22, 2003 in [[Orlando, Florida]].

== Early life ==
Oh was born in [[Jinju]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]] and grew up in [[Changnyeong County]]. In the second year of middle school, Oh followed a group of friends to an audition for [[SM Entertainment]], held in [[Daegu]], but was rejected. However, another company contacted her saying that she had qualified and she moved to Seoul, debuting four months later at the age of 15.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Oh was accepted into Anyang Arts High School after her band's disbandment and went on to become an actress. She changed her name from Haet-nim to Yeon-seo after consulting a shaman with her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3027585|title=Young people are taking up new names|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oh then entered [[Dongguk University]], joining the theater and film department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=213&amp;aid=0000933264|title=김주현 &quot;대학동기 오연서 '엽기녀' 발탁, 내가봐도 잘어울려&quot;[인터뷰③]|date=15 December 2016|website=TV Report|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–present: Breakthrough===
Oh played the lead role of Jang Bo-ri, a compassionate and selfless person, in the highly acclaimed series ''[[Jang Bo-ri is Here!]]'' (2014).

The series aired on PTV. &lt;ref name=&quot;images&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_28-9-2005_pg7_47 |title=Daily Times - Leading News Resource of Pakistan |access-date=2008-11-30 |archive-date=2009-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424201505/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_28-9-2005_pg7_47 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
After achieving television success, Qazi transitioned into the [[Lollywood]] film industry in 1986. His film debut as the lead role in Nazar Shabab's ''Ruby,'' alongside veteran co-stars [[Mustafa Qureshi]], [[Shafi Mohammad]], [[Sabeeta]] and [[Saeed Khan Rangeela|Rangeela]]. The film was met with critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=&quot;images&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jahan&quot; /&gt; 

Qazi's role in the film was also notable because [[Jawed Sheikh|Jawed Shiekh]] had originally been cast for the lead role but quit in order to travel to [[India]] with [[Salma Agha]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;jahan&quot; /&gt; Around the same time, Jawed had also been cast as Izhar for the film ''Bangkok'' ''Ke Chor.'' Director [[Jan Mohammad]] fired Jawed and awarded the role to Qazi.&lt;ref name=&quot;jahan&quot; /&gt; 

In his third movie, ''Love in Nepal'' (1987) Qazi acted opposite Shabnam, Pakistan's top film actress at that time in a unique young-to-old character role.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

His collaborations with Jan Muhammad included popular films including ''Manila ki bijlyan'', ''Roop ki rani,'' and ''Choron ka baadshah''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jahan&quot; /&gt; He also teamed up with the [[Sultan Rahi]] in a series of Punjabi films such as ''Abdullah the Great'', ''Irada'', ''Gujjar baadshah'', ''Lahori baadshah'', ''Pajero group'', ''Ghunda,'' and ''Dilari''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jahan&quot; /&gt; Hence he was more of an action hero than a romantic one.&lt;ref name=&quot;images&quot; /&gt; His only [[SciFi|science fiction]] film, ''Sar kata insaan'', in which he played the role of a police investigator, won 8 Nigar Awards. 

==Retirement==
Qazi retired from the film industry in 2003 because he was dismayed by the poor quality of [[Lollywood]] films and by local film industry politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dawn.com/2007/12/25/local5.htm| title = KARACHI: Actor Izhar Qazi passes away - Newspaper - DAWN.COM| date = 25 December 2007}} &lt;/ref&gt; He then concentrated on his real estate business.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn&quot; /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the studio Clemo builds complex and densely textured compositions, developing them through a process of composition and improvisation, with contributions from a diverse group of musicians.

==Musical career==
===Sound – Inhale the Colours===
[[File:Philip Clemo live, 2017.jpg|thumb|Philip Clemo live, 2017]]
Clemo's first two albums were collaborative works with violinist [[Ysanne Spevack]], aka Mee.&lt;ref name=BBCMusic/&gt; The pair shared the composition credits, but used Clemo's multi-layered approach to creation and composition. ''Sound – Inhale the Colours'' was created in 1996/7 largely in Sydney, Australia, featuring contributions from an additional eleven musicians. Well reviewed by critics on release, it remained a question for them as to whether it was [[jazz]], [[ambient electronica]] or [[World music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sound – Inhale the Colours|author=Tony Marcus|publisher=[[Mix Mag]]|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sound – Inhale the Colours|author=Andrew Rawnsley|publisher=[[XLR8R]]|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundzero===
A second collaborative album ''Soundzero'' was completed in 1999, but only released in March 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundzero&quot;&gt;As stated in the [http://www.chaindlk.com/reviews/?id=4992 Chain D.L.K. review]&lt;/ref&gt; Both albums featured, amongst others, Phil Slater on trumpet and Tarlochan (Bobby) Singh on [[tabla]]. On ''Soundzero'', Jazz singer [[Cleveland Watkiss]], often heavily processed, made a guest appearance; whilst the album was also the first appearance of a British [[rhythm section]], consisting of: Mark Sanders (drums); John Edwards (double bass); and [[Pete Lockett]] (percussion).&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt;

===Ambiguous Dialogues===
Clemo's third album ''Ambiguous Dialogues'', the first under his own name, was released in 2004 on Metier Jazz.&lt;ref name=BBCMusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManMcD/&gt; Featuring 12 musicians, as well as the British rhythm section it involved contributions from [[Clive Bell]] (reeds), and Tom Chant (soprano saxophone and [[bass clarinet]]). Clemo toured the work post the album's release, which was well reviewed and received.&lt;ref name=GuardRooms/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/28/jazz|title=Philip Clemo – 93 Feet East, London|author=John Fordham|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 March 2006|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, he became a judge for the first time at the British Composer Awards for the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]], which he has since undertaken again in 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCMusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManMcD/&gt;

===The Rooms===
In October 2008, Clemo released his fourth album ''The Rooms''. A musical progression through different sound &quot;rooms&quot; or &quot;spaces&quot;, it featured 22 musicians including: Clive Bell; [[Theo Travis]] (saxophone and [[flute]]); Simon Hopkins (electric guitar); [[B.J. Cole|B.J Cole]] (pedal steel); [[Henry Lowther (musician)|Henry Lowther]] (trumpet and flugelhorn); and a [[Prague]] [[string quartet]]. Clemo credited legendary sound engineer Phill Brown, who has worked with [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bob Marley]] among others, for his invaluable contribution to the recording process of ''The Rooms''. The album was critically acclaimed, and reviewed as floating somewhere between [[jazz]], rock and soundtrack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mwzf|title=Philip Clemo – The Rooms|author=Chris Jones|publisher=BBC Music|date=October 2008|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics describing it as intelligent &quot;fourth world&quot; [[Electronic jazz|electro-jazz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JazWzRooms&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WireRooms&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllAbtJz&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=17571#.U2EOL6LqXpd|title=Philip Clemo|author=Chris Fortescue|magazine=[[All About Jazz]]|date=October 2008|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardRooms&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/17/jazz|title=Jazz review: Philip Clemo: The Rooms|author=John L Walters|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesmer===
Up to this point, one of Clemo's key instruments of choice to compose with was the guitar. But having become quite bored with what he was playing on it,&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt; he moved for his next album to the piano. For a year he created improvisations, charting a deeply personal journey through significant life experiences and environments.&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt; These were then given to pianist [http://www.kevinpollard.com/ Kevin Pollard] to interpret and expand, with Clemo then adding additional guitar pieces to shape the compositions.&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt; With the basic structure laid out, he then invited 14 additional musicians – one at a time – to &quot;blindly&quot; add their response on top, including: Oren Marshall (tuba); [[B. J. Cole]] (pedal steel guitar); Byron Wallen (trumpet and flugelhorn); Emily Burridge (cello); with [[Thomas Bloch]] ([[Radiohead]], [[Damon Albarn]]) contributing ethereal tones on three instruments (glass harmonica, crystal baschet and ondes martenot). Clemo then heavily edited and shaped their contributions. The album was the first on which Clemo added his own voice, using multi-layering to create harmonies.&lt;ref name=PropMusMesmer/&gt; He finally added additional recorded sounds from places which have great significance to him, including: the river and woods at the end of his childhood garden; his first school; [[Aberdeen railway station]]; [[Redwood National Park]] in northern California; and Plum Village [[Zen Buddhist]] monastery in France.&lt;ref name=ManMcD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mannersmcdade.co.uk/composer/philip-clemo/|title=Philip Clemo|publisher=Manners McDade|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tingen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Royle/&gt; As with ''The Rooms'', most of the sessions were recorded by Phill Brown, who Clemo sees as crucial in both building powerful creative environments, and capturing a high level of sonic detail in the sessions.&lt;ref name=PropMusMesmer/&gt; The end result, ''Mesmer'',&lt;ref name=ManMcD/&gt; was well reviewed by both the music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|website=[[All Music Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|magazine=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainstream press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|newspaper=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d288272-05dd-11e2-bce8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz300MeX88B|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a form of contemporary [[chamber music]] with &quot;improvisation, multi-level musical dialogue and sound design at its core.&quot;&lt;ref name=PropMusMesmer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propermusic.com/product-details/Philip-Clemo-Mesmer-144514|title=Philip Clemo – Mesmer|publisher=propermusic.com|date=October 2012|accessdate=30 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214529/http://www.propermusic.com/product-details/Philip-Clemo-Mesmer-144514|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream Maps===
With contributions from 21 musicians including [[Arve Henriksen]] (trumpet), Evi Vine (voice), Byron Wallen (trumpet, flugelhorn), Oren Marshall (tuba), [[Thomas Bloch]] (glass harmonica, Ondes Martenot), Emily Burridge and Peter Gregson (cellos), Dream Maps was released on 9 September 2016 with a live launch with an 8-piece band including Arve Henriksen and Evi Vine at [[Kings Place]], London, UK on 14 September. The concert was described by Richard Williams on [https://thebluemoment.com/2016/09/14/philip-clemo-at-kings-place/ thebluemoment.com] as &quot;Artfully mixed together with recordings of heartbeats and water by the sound engineer [[Phill Brown]], the music washed gently but insistently over the clearly beguiled near-capacity crowd in Kings Place’s Hall 2... this was Clemo’s first live gig in 10 years; its success should encourage him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo King's Place review|last1=Williams|first1=Richard|url=https://thebluemoment.com/2016/09/14/philip-clemo-at-kings-place/|website=The Blue Moment|date=14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dream Maps was well received by the media with Selwyn Harris in [[Jazzwise]] describing it as &quot;Meditative, trance-like stillness… symphonic ambience… echoes of… Brian Eno and David Sylvian. Miles’ Sketches of Spain reimagined by Jon Hassell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo Dream Maps review|last1=Harris|first1=Selwyn|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com|website=Jazzwise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Moon in [[Prog (magazine)]] said that “Philip Clemo gets close to the edges on his extraordinary sixth album… utterly transfixing”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo Dream Maps review|last1=Moon|first1=Grant|url=http://teamrock.com/review/2016-11-02/philip-clemo-dream-maps-album-review|website=Team Rock|date=2 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Farbey in [[All About Jazz]] said “Mesmerising… irresistible and idiosyncratic. Within a jazz context, could even be regarded as a new kind of third stream” ****&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo Dream Maps review|last1=Farbey|first1=Roger|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/dream-maps-philip-clemo-all-colours-arts-review-by-roger-farbey.php|website=All About Jazz|date=13 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Clemo discussed the making of Dream Maps on the [[BBC Radio 3]] programme [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z6f3q Jazz Now] on 24 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Clemo Dream Maps radio interview|last1=Ryan|first1=Al|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z6f3q|website=Jazz Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film-making==
[[File:Philip_Clemo_filming_in_Norway_2013.jpg|thumb|Philip Clemo filming in Norway 2013]]
Having started out professionally as a production film editor, including working on the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'',&lt;ref name=Arri/&gt; since 1989 Clemo has made a series of [[short films]] which have been shown at festivals around the world.&lt;ref name=RevbNat/&gt;

One of his early films was ''From The Morning On'', a [[travel documentary|travelogue]] based on a day in the Indian sub-continent.&lt;ref name=RevbNat/&gt; He has since travelled extensively throughout South East Asia and Australasia, with both film camera and sound recording equipment.&lt;ref name=RevbNat/&gt; Having used video projections of his film work extensively in his live musical performances, he filmed his first major project, ''The Air Holds Still on My Breath'' in [[Iceland]] in summer 2008. Shown at Cannes Short Film Corner in 2009,&lt;ref name=RevbNat/&gt; the film, a series of [[abstract art|abstract]] &quot;mood paintings&quot; mapping the &quot;[[Seven Ages of Man]]&quot;, features music from ''The Rooms''.&lt;ref name=RevbNat/&gt; It was shot using specialist camera technology to capture extreme slow motion details of geothermal activity and waterfalls, and from the air using a gyro-stabilised camera mounted on a [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name=Arri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/news.html?article=1258&amp;cHash=4ff2ab275077a959e16e3f3fdd6bd773|title=ALEXA, Alura and aurora borealis|author=Kieron Seth|publisher=[[Arri]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot using the same technical combination as ''The Air'', Clemo made the short film ''Melt'', which was shown at 2009 Reykjavik International Film Festival 2009 and 2010 London Short Film Festival.&lt;ref name=RevbNat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/philipclemo|title=Philip Clemo|publisher=[[Reverb Nation]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, Clemo developed ''The Breath Project'', encompassing film and art installation, produced by perfectmotion and Animal Monday. ''Breath'' illustrates the dramas of human life through the metaphor of landscape, from isolation and turmoil to exhilaration and transformation. Moving through the seven phases of human life, through ageing human forms and across different terrains of the human body, we see comparisons with the environments of planet Earth.&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; Clemo has presented TEDX and TED talks about his work on Breath. He is currently working with Dr Thomas Moors and the charity Shout at Cancer on 'From Silence Into Song' which honours the legacy of the survivor trees of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, hooking them up to sensors exactly 75 years after the bombs were dropped, and an extraordinary choir of cancer survivors who have learnt how to sing after the removal of their voiceboxes.

==Live performance==

Since 2016, Clemo has been performing with his '''Dream Maps Live''' band, working with a diverse group of musicians including [[Arve Henriksen]] (trumpet), Byron Wallen (trumpet, flugelhron), [[B. J. Cole]] (pedal steel), Evi Vine (voice), Simon Edwards (bass), [[Martyn Barker]] (drums, percussion), Emily Burridge (cello) and Steven Hill (guitar &amp; keys).

Of Mackall's one man show, ''Wherever I Go, There we Are''. ''[[LA Weekly]]'' wrote that his &quot;wealth of experience as a voiceover artist and comedy scribe manifests itself in his artfully layered, near flawlessly timed and often funny solo act.&quot; They noted that his personal enthusiasm connected with the audience in a manner that reminded of [[Will Rogers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Music career==
Maher's father and mother were from [[Castledermot]], [[Athy]], [[Kildare]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newhormonesinfo.com/category/the-full-story/ |first=Justin |last=Toland |year=2008 |title=Indie Originals: The New Hormones Story |website=Newhormonesinfo.com |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, still a 16-year-old schoolboy from [[St Bede's College, Manchester|St Bede's College]], [[Whalley Range, Greater Manchester|Whalley Range]], Manchester, he joined punk band [[Buzzcocks]], then led by [[Howard Devoto]], who was the lead vocalist. After the first Buzzcocks dissolving in 1981, he collaborated with [[Pauline Murray]] of [[The Invisible Girls]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NME Rock 'N' Roll Years&quot;/&gt; and formed along with [[Steve Diggle]] (also of Buzzcocks) a band called [[Flag of Convenience (band)|Flag of Convenience]], in 1982, but he quit shortly afterwards. In 1981, he was drumming with [[Pete Wylie]] in Wah!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nkvdrecords.com/buzzcock.htm |title=Buzzcocks |work=NKVD Records |accessdate=18 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221024356/http://www.nkvdrecords.com/buzzcock.htm |archivedate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzzcocks reunited in late 1989 for a month long tour of the US and seven shows in the UK. While the other members of the band decided to continue, Maher left to continue with his VW business (see below). He returned once more in early 1992, when his replacement ([[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]], formerly of [[The Smiths]]), quit Buzzcocks on the eve of a European and Japanese tour.

In May 2012, Maher stepped out of musical retirement to rejoin Buzzcocks for two one-off shows: his first public appearance behind a drum kit in 20 years. The concerts took place at Manchester Apollo and London's Brixton Academy. Howard Devoto, the band's original vocalist also joined the band on stage for five songs – all four tracks from their debut EP, ''Spiral Scratch'', plus a cover version of The Troggs' &quot;Can't Control Myself&quot;. Maher spoke about his brief return to the stage in an interview with online fanzine ''Mudkiss''. Another interview with Maher appears in the first issue of ''The Drummers Journal''.

In 2014, Maher reunited with another Manchester band he had previously been involved with during his Buzzcocks years: The Things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethingsband.com/ |title=The Things |website=Thethingsband.com |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded several songs, both old and new, during the summer of 2014. An EP (entitled ''EP1'') containing four tracks was released in mid 2015.

In 2015, Maher was back in the recording studio with old friends Pauline Murray and Robert Blamire, working on a new [[Penetration (band)|Penetration]] album – the first since the band's 1979 release, ''Coming Up For Air''. Maher and Blamire first worked together in 1978, on [[Patrik Fitzgerald]]'s debut album ''Grubby Stories''. In 1980 they also worked together on the [[Martin Hannett]] produced [[Pauline Murray and the Invisible Girls (album)|Pauline Murray and the Invisible Girls]] album. The new album ''Resolution'' took the runner-up spot in Vive Le Rock's Top 50 albums of 2015.

In August 2015, the website [[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]] published an in-depth interview with Maher.

==Drag racing==
When Maher first quit the [[music industry]] in the 1980s, he developed an interest in car [[drag racing]], racing [[VW Beetle]]s as part of the VWDRC. This led him to develop a successful business, '''John Maher Racing''', building performance engines. After reuniting with Buzzcocks in 1989, he retired from music in 1992 after a tour, and returned to his Volkswagen business in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], in the south of [[Manchester]]. In 1999, Maher's workshop was featured in the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] programme ''Stars &amp; Cars''. This featured footage of his former incarnation as a drummer, a tour of his workshop, and interviews. 

Maher relocated his business from Manchester to the [[Isle of Harris]] in Scotland in 2002. In 2010 he appeared on the [[BBC Alba]] motoring programme ''Air an Rathad''. The interview features footage inside his workshop on the Isle of Harris, a brief interview and a drive in one of his customers' VW Beetle.

==Photography==
Since 2009, Maher has gained recognition for his photography; in particular his long-exposure night photographs and interior images of abandoned Hebridean homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13410935.It_is_time_to_wield_the_stick_on_empty_homes/ |title=It is time to wield the stick on empty homes |date=1 June 2015 |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The lonely island: abandoned houses of the Hebrides – in pictures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/aug/17/nobodys-home-john-maher-outer-hebrides-photography-in-pictures |work=The Guardian |date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Since June 10, 1978, Nasaw has been married to [[Dinitia Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;''Cumberland Evening Times'' (June 26, 1967):9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wps.prenhall.com/hss_hirschberg_millennium_4/29/7559/1935320.cw/index.html |title=Dinitia Smith |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201004931/http://wps.prenhall.com/hss_hirschberg_millennium_4/29/7559/1935320.cw/index.html |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; a novelist, [[Emmy award]]-winning filmmaker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/dinitia-smith-leaves-full-time-post-at-nyt_b3520 &quot;Dinitia Smith Leaves Full-Time Post at NYT&quot;] ''Galleycat'' (December 21, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist, who worked as a correspondent for ''The New York Times'' for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nasaw, [http://www.danielnasaw.com/about &quot;About&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719044907/http://www.danielnasaw.com/about |date=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making Books |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are the parents of twin sons: Peter Caleb Nasaw and journalist Daniel Allen Nasaw, born in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;highbeam1945&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://www.danielnasaw.com/about |publisher=Daniel Nasaw |access-date=July 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719044907/http://www.danielnasaw.com/about |archive-date=July 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thoughts ==
Although he has published three biographies, Nasaw describes himself as an academic historian, rather than a biographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Taming Of the Story |date=June 5, 2006 |newspaper=New York Sun |author=Gary Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historian, he says, &quot;sweeps away the fables, the myths, the stories&quot; and places scholarly subjects &quot;in time and over time&quot;, while for biographers, the organization of the work is laid out in advance. &quot;Writing history is not an art but a craft,&quot; Nasaw has said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Writers Beware: History Is an Art, Not a Toaster |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 28, 2002 |author=Martin Arnold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/28/books/making-books-writers-beware-history-is-an-art-not-a-toaster.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It requires interpretation and fifty sources and integrating and assembling this material into a story told by an individual voice.&quot;

* ''The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy'' (Penguin Press, November 2012)
Following the success of Nasaw's 2000 biography of [[William Randolph Hearst]], Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] approached Nasaw to write a biography of his father, Kennedy patriarch [[Joseph P. Kennedy]]. Nasaw told the family that as an academic historian, he had no interest in writing an &quot;authorized biography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AUTHOR ENJOYS FULL ACCESS FOR BOOK ON KENNEDY PATRIARCH |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=August 5, 2006 |author=David Mehegan}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I told him I would undertake this project if I had guarantees to see all the documents at the Kennedy Library and elsewhere, and if I were free to write whatever I wanted, with no censorship or interference of any kind,&quot; Nasaw said. Senator Kennedy said he had read and admired Nasaw's book on Hearst and believed the historian would make a &quot;fair evaluation of his life and contributions.&quot; The Kennedy family agreed to sit for interviews and to make Joseph Kennedy's private papers available. After publication, the book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 2013.

{{nihongo|'''Hitoshi Okamoto'''|岡本 仁志}} is a Japanese guitarist, composer, arranger and the former member of the J-pop band [[Garnet Crow]] in years 1999-2013, as well as some of his own solo releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitoshi Okamoto|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hitoshi+Okamoto|work=discogs.com|access-date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Since the release of Okamoto's 2010 solo album &quot;Now Printing...&quot;, he has used the stage name &quot;Super Light&quot; for his solo projects. As a solo artist, Okamoto writes the majority of his songs by himself, however, fellow '''Garnet Crow''' member [[Azuki Nana|Nana Azuki]] has written lyrics for some of his songs. Okamoto is sometimes referred to with the nickname &quot;Okamocchi&quot; (おかもっち). He has created an alternate version of the &quot;GARNET CROW&quot; songs &quot;Crystal Gauge&quot; and &quot;[[Mysterious Eyes]]&quot;, the latter of which Okamoto had released under the &quot;Super Light&quot; name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROFILE Super Light|url=http://www.giza.co.jp/superlight/profile/index.html|website=Super Light Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During live performances as a solo artist, Okamoto sometimes plays &quot;Garnet Crow&quot; songs, or even invites the other Garnet members to appear as guest musicians. In &quot;Garnet Crow&quot; live performances, Okamoto provides back-up vocals in addition to playing the guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=メンバープロフィール 岡本仁志|url=http://garnetcrow.com/profile/|website=Garnet Crow Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful career performing daily on stage, radio and television in Venezuela, Barabas moved to San Diego in 1966 seeking greater opportunities. The Southern California music scene inspired and cultivated his interest in jazz and soon he was opening for figures such as [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Bill Evans]] and [[Ramsey Lewis]]. He later became the house pianist for a five-star resort, and it was during his tenure there that he began playing his own compositions.

==Commercial success==

Barabas released 12 CD's, three of which made the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]]. ''Sedona Suite'' charted number 12 and held that position for 29 weeks.

'''Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown''' (March 4, 1993&amp;nbsp;– July 26, 2015) was an American [[reality television]] personality. She was the daughter and only child of singers [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Bobby Brown]]. Her parents' fame kept Brown in the public eye, as did her appearances on the reality show ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]''.

Brown intended on becoming a singer, actress, and dancer like her parents. She performed with her mother at concerts a number of times, as well as singing a cover of her mother's song &quot;[[I'm Your Baby Tonight (song)|I'm Your Baby Tonight]]&quot; on ''Being Bobby Brown''. She appeared as herself on a number of television shows and specials, and played a role on [[Tyler Perry]]'s television series ''[[For Better or Worse (2011 TV series)|For Better or Worse]]'' in 2012.

On January 31, 2015, Brown was found unconscious in a bathtub in her home, which was similar to the fate of her mother. After being in a [[coma]] for nearly six months, Brown died from [[lobar pneumonia]] on July&amp;nbsp;26, 2015, at the age of 22.

===Autopsy report===
The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said it used both medical records and police investigative files to arrive at a determination for Brown's cause of death.

'''Krista Polvere''' is an Australian-born singer/songwriter from [[Adelaide]], but resides in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Polvere moved to Sydney at a young age to study acting and music. Polvere's father, a former band manager, immigrated from [[Naples]], Italy and her mother is of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.

Playing shows around the small bars and clubs in Adelaide, Polvere moved to [[Melbourne]] for its live music culture. Polvere ventured to New York City for an adventure, traveling to the heart of where the folk scene began. Polvere is noted to be a huge [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] fan and was mesmerized by the history of the music scene in NYC. Soon after getting to NYC, Polvere was introduced to [[Jon Graboff]] of [[The Cardinals (rock band)|The Cardinals]], which led to her meeting with [[Ryan Adams]], with whom she co-wrote tracks for her debut album ''Here Be Dragons''.

Recording ''Here Be Dragons'' in [[Kingston, New York]] with [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[Malcolm Burn]], Polvere had [[Ryan Adams]] play guitar and piano on her album and Grasshopper from [[Mercury Rev]] appear on the recording. Directly after finishing the recording process, Polvere moved back to Australia. Critically acclaimed ''Here Be Dragons'' was released in Australia through independent Sydney-based label Inertia. Polvere has been compared to musicians [[Nick Drake]] and [[Mazzy Star]]. Krista Polvere has also worked with well-known Australian artists [[Mark Lizotte]] (aka Diesel) and [[Monique Brumby]].

Polvere accompanied [[Ryan Adams]] and [[The Cardinals]] on their national Australian tour to sell out shows. Polvere also opened for Canadian folk man [[Ron Sexsmith]] on a national tour and she toured with [[Steve Earle]] playing to sell out crowds.

Through an introduction from a good friend Polvere started talking ideas for her second record with [[Marc Ford]] ([[The Black Crowes]]) and his long-time friend and music collaborator Anthony Arvizu. 
 
Marc and Anthony have co-produced two of [[Ryan Bingham]]'s records and Marc, of course is world-renowned for his outstanding guitar playing and style. From these discussions it became clear that this would be the right match. Marc's purist approach meant that the album was recorded live in their [http://www.compoundstudio.com/ Long Beach Californian studio, The Compound].

Working within a tight timeframe of 3 weeks for recording and mixing of 13 tracks, meant that everyone worked hard and intuitively. [[Ryan Adams]] played guitar and sang backing vocals.

This album showcases Polvere's song writing ability and voice. [[Ryan Adams]] was most recently quoted in an interview with Melbourne's [[Herald Sun]] as saying:
[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/ryan-adams-sifts-through-ashes/story-fn6bn9st-1226183883549 “She is going to be the next big thing, I just recorded some music with her for her new record in California,&quot; he says. &quot;I did some guitar and some vocals and I would say this: I have always been impressed by her. She's always impressed me as a songwriter and a friend. But the songs I've heard this time, I can honestly say I had no idea that she was capable of what I heard.&quot;I don't say that to undermine her – I was shocked at how intricate it was. From what I've heard it's such a powerful record. It's going to be a real game-changer.&quot;]

Polvere released her second album 'Reservoir Drive' in 2013.

After the release of that album she spent more time in America recording a third album with producer Brian Elijah Smith, which is due to be released in 2016. The first single from the album Shut Up and Ride was released on November 27. The recordings were made over an intense period in a basement studio fuelled by an intense relationship between the pair resulting in an album of rare emotional vulnerability and fire.

“There is a story within it all that makes this album even more intense and special. You may hear it all coming through the songs, through my voice. The producer and instrumentalist on the album was my lover at the time. When I listen to the record now I can hear the ghosts of our love and the listener may too”, said Polvere of the album.

The single is accompanied by a video shot in both regional Australia and rural Virginia in which the artist plays two roles – a free-spirited, independent woman travelling the dusty backroads of Australia and a mysterious, ghostly seductress inhabiting the Virginian woods. The juxtaposition reflects the character of Krista Polvere, a true Gemini, having two very different sides to her personality.

“I feel like the clip represents a darker, romantic and ambivalent side which is lost in the woods searching whimsically for something she knows doesn’t exist. There is sadness in that. And then a more strong, independent and fearless version of me who desires the thrill and nothing more”.

Prior to the release of the single Polvere commenced a short residency at Melbourne’s Gasometer Hotel along with a series of other shows around Victoria and a three-day stint at Australian Music Week in Sydney.

In an article from ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 13 May 1987, jazz critic Gail Brennan wrote: &quot;Mark Simmond's Freeboppers devastated the Basement with an unbroken hour-and-a-half orgy of rhythm and fire.&quot; The article reviews a double-bill with the Dale Barlow Quintet at Sydney's most renowned jazz venue, The Basement, on 11 May 1987. It goes on to say Mark &quot;led a band that had played in public for a month (at the Piccadilly) and their confidence and cohesion were glorious to hear&quot; and concludes; &quot;It is not often that a reviewer of Australian jazz has no choice but to gush. This was one of those nights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald, 13 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark retired from regular public performance in the early 2000s, but continued to play music with fellow musicians up until his death. His last live performance- a duet with Jeffrey Wegener, took place in Leichhardt, New South Wales, in 2019. Wegener says that Simmonds, on this occasion, &quot;played magnificently&quot;.

'''Rosa Rio''' (June 2, 1902 – May 13, 2010) was the [[stage name]] of American concert pianist Elizabeth Raub, who also provided scores and arrangement for theater, radio, television and film productions later becoming a teacher of music and voice.  She started her career as a theatre performer before becoming a [[silent film]] accompanist, after which she became a leading organist on network radio and television for soap operas and dramas. In 1993 she reprised her film accompaniment career in Florida, providing the scores for early productions, some of which she had accompanied some 80 years earlier, on their release to cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytbio&quot;/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rio was born as '''Elizabeth Raub''' and raised in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;washpostobit&quot;/&gt; She began playing piano at the age of four and started taking lessons at the age of eight. At age nine she played piano at a silent movie theater for the first time. She studied music at Oberlin College and at the Eastman School of Music.
Her instrument of choice was a [[Wurlitzer]] pipe organ.
She married her professor at Eastman, organist John Hammond; they had a son, John Farnsworth Hammond III, who preceded her in death. The marriage ended in divorce. She later married Bill Yeoman, her husband of 63 years. She had three grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and a pet snail named Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpostobit&quot; /&gt;

Bill Yeoman, her husband, said that Raub adopted the stage name of Rosa Rio because it fitted easily on a theater marquee.

===Motion Pictures===
As a theater organist, Rio performed in Syracuse, at Loews theaters in [[New York City]], at the Saenger Southeastern theater chain, the Scranton Paramount, Brooklyn Fox Theatre, RKO Albee, and the [[Brooklyn Paramount Theater|Brooklyn Paramount]].&lt;ref name=rio&gt;[http://www.goldenage-wtic.org/gaor-11.html The Golden Age of Radio: Rosa Rio]&lt;/ref&gt; She was working at the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Saenger Theatre]] in her hometown of New Orleans when [[Al Jolson]]'s ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' was released, signaling the end of the silent film era.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpostobit&quot;/&gt; Among the films she composed for and provided accompaniment for were ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of The Opera]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and the seminal ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''.

===Radio===
[[File:Rosariogregwilliam.png|thumb|Caricature of Rosa Rio reflecting on her career as a staff organist for NBC Radio.]]
Known as &quot;Queen of the Soaps,&quot; Rio worked for 22 years in radio, providing the organ background music for 24 radio soap operas and radio dramas, and playing an average of five to seven shows per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varietyobit&quot;&gt;[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019440.html?categoryId=25&amp;cs=1 &quot;Musician Rosa Rio dies at 107: Silent film organist worked on NBC shows&quot;], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some days she went from one program immediately to another—as when ''Lorenzo Jones'' and ''Bob and Ray'' were adjacent on NBC's schedule during the early 1950s—with less than 50 seconds to run from one NBC studio to another .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Some of the programs she played for included ''[[Bob and Ray]]'', ''[[Ethel and Albert]]'', ''Front Page Farrell'', ''[[Lorenzo Jones]]'', ''[[My True Story]]'', ''[[The Shadow]]'' and ''[[When a Girl Marries]]''.

During [[World War II]] she had her own radio show, ''Rosa Rio Rhythms''.

===Television and teaching===
Rio made a smooth transition into television, playing for shows such as ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[Today (NBC program)|the Today Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampatheatre.org/Rosa/Still%20Coming%20Up%20Rosa.pdf |title=Schroeder, Tara. &quot;Still Coming up Rosa&quot;, ''Theatre Organ: Journal of the American Theatre Organ Society'', September;October 2001 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105205734/http://www.tampatheatre.org/Rosa/Still%20Coming%20Up%20Rosa.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to radio, television offered fewer opportunities for work. Rio later moved to [[Connecticut]], where she opened a music school with classes in voice, organ and piano.

===Video scores===
During the 1980s, she provided scores and [[Hammond organ]] accompaniment to more than 370 silent films released on video by [[Video Yesteryear]].&lt;ref name=rio/&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Rosa Rio at the Tampa Theatre Wurlitzer (May 2006).jpg|thumb|left|Rosa Rio at the Tampa Theatre Wurlitzer (May 2006)]]

In 1993, Rio moved to [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] in [[Florida]], where she played accompaniment to silent films at the [[Tampa Theatre]]. She was still providing silent film accompaniment up  to her death, including a screening of the [[Buster Keaton]] film ''[[One Week (1920 film)|One Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tampatheatre.org/about/rosa-rio/ Tampa Theatre: Rosa Rio]&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the stage of the Tampa Theatre in 2007 that she first publicly gave her real age, which she had kept to herself for decades due to age discrimination dating back to her network radio years.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Because Rio never celebrated birthdays, some of her family members were not aware of her age until the night before her Tampa Theatre &quot;confession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; She celebrated her 107th birthday in June 2009.

She broke her hip in March 2010 and suffered a bout of influenza; however, she continued to perform on her five-foot Grand Piano. Rio died on May 13, less than three weeks before her 108th birthday. Her organ arrangements remain in print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelsmusicservice.com Michael's Music Service], ''St. Petersburg Times,&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Kapp''' (October 9, 1936 – June 4, 2006) was an American [[conducting|conductor]].

Richard Kapp was born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/newstimes/obituary.aspx?pid=18026327 |title=Richard Kapp |website=Legacy.com |access-date=September 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a child piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]]. He studied German political history at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1957.  He then went abroad on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]] and studied conducting, composition, and piano at the Stuttgart [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Staatliche Hochschule für Musik]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Kapp-Richard.htm |title=Richard Kapp (Conductor) |first1=Aryeh |last1=Oron |first2=Thomas H. |last2=Pease |access-date=September 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonybmgmasterworks.com/artists/richardkapp/ |title=Richard Kapp |access-date=September 8, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827162913/http://www.sonybmgmasterworks.com/artists/richardkapp/ |archive-date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapp started his musical career as a vocal coach at the [[Theater Basel|Basel Stadttheater]], [[Switzerland]]. He then moved back in the United States and served as music director of the Opera Theater of the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in New York from 1963 to 1965.  While in New York City he earned a law degree from the [[New York University]] in 1966.  He also studied conducting, piano and harpsichord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oron&quot; /&gt;

In 1968 Richard Kapp founded the chamber orchestra [[Philharmonia Virtuosi]] of New York.  He served as their musical director for the rest of his life.  Among other notable concerts the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York gave the inaugural concert at the Performing Arts Center at the [[State University of New York at Purchase]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kapp |first=Richard |title=Program Notes to Vivaldi's Favorites |volume=1 |date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philharmonia Virtuosi]] of New York performed and recorded until 2004 when concerts were suspended when Kapp became ill.

With the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York Kapp released a series of classical &quot;greatest hits&quot; records.  This included the 1977 album &quot;Greatest Hits of 1720&quot; on [[CBS Masterworks]]. These albums were collections of shorter more accessible repertoire that were designed to have popular appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oron&quot; /&gt; Kapp and the Philharmonia Virtuosi also recorded a notable collection of three volumes of &quot;Vivaldi's Favorites&quot;.

Kapp was the first of the original plaintiffs in ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', a 2012 [[United States Supreme Court]] that held that restoration of copyrights under the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] was not unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Saunders |first=Christina |title=Golan v.

Kapp died at his home in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Connecticut]], at the age of 69 from cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;obituary&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
Ruth Lorenzo was born on 10 November 1982 in the [[Region of Murcia]], in south-eastern Spain. At a very young age she became a fan of the musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' and although she had no idea of what the words meant she would sing along to the songs in English. When she was six years old she discovered music by Catalan opera singer [[Montserrat Caballé]], and after her mother bought her an album by Caballé, Lorenzo began to sing opera, imitating Caballé's vocals until she was pitch perfect. At the age of 12, Lorenzo's family moved to [[Utah]] in the [[United States]] and this was the first time she had the opportunity to be involved in music at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2008/12/05/tentaciones/1228504974_850215.html|title=La murciana que cabreó a Price|newspaper=El País|date=2008-12-05|access-date=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much encouragement from her teachers, Lorenzo was entered into competitions and played lead roles in musical productions such as ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''My Fair Lady''. When Lorenzo turned 16 the family returned to Spain and although having had singing lessons by this time, she had to cancel these lessons due to family financial difficulty and as a result Lorenzo gave up on her dream of becoming a recording artist. When Lorenzo was 19 she joined a rock band, which was a challenge for her as she had only sung opera music.  She also made a big decision to quit her job in her family's business in order to pursue her dreams once again, but after three years of touring around Spain the group decided to split up. Ruth landed a contract at [[Polaris World]] where as well as performing, she worked as a PR consultant.

==Career==
===2008: ''The X Factor''===
{{Main|The X Factor (UK series 5)}}
In 2008, Lorenzo auditioned for the fifth series of ''The X Factor'' in front of judges [[Simon Cowell]], [[Cheryl Cole]] and [[Louis Walsh]]. She sang &quot;[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]&quot;. She impressed the judges and made it through to the next stage of the show, &quot;bootcamp&quot;. Lorenzo passed both stages of bootcamp and was sent to [[St. Tropez]] with the other successful contestants from the over-25s category. There she auditioned in front of [[Dannii Minogue]] who was her ''X Factor'' mentor. After an emotional performance of &quot;[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]&quot;, sung in Spanish, Minogue decided to pick Lorenzo for her final three who would proceed to the live shows. On the first live show she sang &quot;[[Take My Breath Away]]&quot; in English and Spanish. She had mainly good comments, especially from Cowell, who told her she should sing in Spanish more often. However, the next week Lorenzo sang &quot;[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]&quot; in English only, and ended up in the bottom two. She performed &quot;[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]&quot; in the singoff, and it saved her into the next week. In Week 5, Lorenzo was in the bottom two again against one of the crowd favourites [[Laura White]]. This time she sang &quot;[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]&quot; and was saved by Cowell, Minogue and Walsh. Her performance was overshadowed by the uproar over White's departure. Voting statistics revealed that White received more votes than Lorenzo meaning if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, White would’ve been saved. During [[Take That]] week, Lorenzo sang &quot;[[Love Ain't Here Anymore]]&quot;. She received high praise for her performance, with Cowell saying it was sensational. By the quarter-final, Lorenzo was Minogue's last remaining act and she was eliminated after receiving the fewest public votes. Lorenzo bowed out with another performance of &quot;[[Always (Bon Jovi song)|Always]]&quot;. Former friend [[Alexandra Burke]] went on to win the show.

'''Irving Kaufman''' (February 8, 1890 &amp;ndash; January 3, 1976) was a prolific American early twentieth century singer, recording artist and [[vaudeville]] performer.

==Life and career==
Kaufman was born '''Isidore Kaufman''' in [[Syracuse, New York]], the son of [[Russian people|Russian]] [[Russian Jewish|Jewish]] immigrants. He was a member of ''The Kaufman Brothers'', along with his brothers Phillip and Jack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gracyk|first=Tim|title=Irving Kaufman (8 February 1890 - 3 January 1976)|url=http://www.gracyk.com/kaufman.shtml|work=Popular American Recording Artists|access-date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1913 through 1919 Kaufman was part of [[Avon Comedy Four|The Avon Comedy Four]], a popular comedy and music group that was formed in 1902. Two of the group's members went on to fame as [[Smith and Dale]]. Kaufman began recording in 1914, and recorded for [[Victor Records|Victor]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Aeolian Company|Vocalion]], [[Gennett Records|Gennett]], [[Edison Records|Edison]], [[Harmony Records|Harmony]], as well as all of the dime labels ([[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Perfect Records|Perfect]], etc.). Early in his career, when recording for Edison and Victor, he recorded under his own name, but he also used a number of (non-Jewish-sounding) aliases including 'Tom Frawley'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irving Kaufman as Lazy Dan|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/LAB/JERRYLEE/vocalists/0000000b.html|work=The LAB On-Line Photo Archive|publisher=Library of American Broadcasting|access-date=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305015100/http://www.lib.umd.edu/LAB/JERRYLEE/vocalists/0000000b.html|archive-date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barna|first=Ryan|title=The Final Years of Irving Kaufman: An Illustrated Discography (1938-1974)|url=http://www.phonostalgia.com/kaufman/final.html|publisher=Phonostalgia|access-date=5 September 2013|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, as in the case of several of his 1927 &quot;Broadway Bell-Hops&quot; vocals, he was merely credited as &quot;Vocal Chorus&quot;. He was often credited as &quot;vocal refrain by George Beaver&quot; on the dime store labels.

Kaufman was a singer in the vaudeville style, and although he was not considered a jazz singer, he nonetheless sang on recordings accompanied by some of the foremost jazz figures of the 1920s, including [[Leon &quot;Bix&quot; Beiderbecke]], [[Frank Trumbauer]], [[the Dorsey Brothers]], [[Red Nichols]], [[Miff Mole]], and [[Eddie Lang]]. His voice recorded well - both acoustically and electrically - and was one of the most prolific singers during the 1920s.

Kaufman retired after a heart attack in 1949, and made no further commercial recordings until 1974, when a 2-LP set titled ''Reminisce With Irving Kaufman'' was released. It consisted mostly of transcriptions of his old recordings, but included several new cuts of Kaufman singing, accompanied by his second wife, Belle Brooks (1904–93). After his retirement, he lived in [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref name=Radio&gt;{{cite news|title=Palm Springs Home To Radio Veterans: Stars of 'Golden Era'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0qlRAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=palm-springs&amp;pg=3384%2C2762174|access-date=September 30, 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=December 18, 1974|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died January 3, 1976 in [[Indio, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/01/05/archives/irving-kaufman-singer-85-dead-early-radio-and-recording-artist.html ''The New York Times'', 5 January 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rena Riffel''' (born March 5, 1969) is an American actress, singer, dancer, model, writer, producer, and director.  She is known for her supporting roles in films such as ''[[Showgirls]]'', ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'', and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.

==''Showgirls''==
Riffel landed her breakthrough role in the 1995 film ''[[Showgirls]]'' starring [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[Gina Gershon]], and [[Kyle MacLachlan]]. Initially reading for the lead role of Cristal Connors, Riffel was cast in the supporting role of Penny/Hope after director [[Paul Verhoeven]] decided that she was too young to play an aging showgirl.

While on the set of ''Showgirls'', Riffel approached the music supervisor with a song she recorded, &quot;Deep Kiss&quot;. The music supervisor tested the song on the production office (without telling them it had been written by one of the actresses) to determine if it was suitable for the film. Director Paul Verhoeven listened to the song and decided to include it in the [[lap dance]] scene at the Cheetah strip club.

Although an initial box office failure, ''Showgirls'' enjoyed success in the home video market, generating more than $100 million in video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time best sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Wood |date=22 September 2015 |access-date=30 August 2021 |title=Showgirls': Paul Verhoeven on the Greatest Stripper Movie Ever Made|publisher=Rollingstone.com
|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/showgirls-paul-verhoeven-on-the-greatest-stripper-movie-ever-made-54740/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611131729/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/showgirls-paul-verhoeven-on-the-greatest-stripper-movie-ever-made-54740/ |archive-date=2020-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2004 re-release as a DVD limited edition box set, Riffel, along with cast members Lin Tucci and Patrick Bristow, had their hand prints and names put in cement in front of the Hollywood Vista Theater at the red carpet event where they were also interviewed by ''[[Access Hollywood]]''. Riffel and Bristow were also special guests at Peaches Christ's Midnight Mass midnight screening of ''Showgirls'' in 2008 in San Francisco, California. They were interviewed on stage after the live performance of the Goddess volcano dance performed by drag queens in gold lamé and featuring [[Peaches Christ]] as Goddess.

When asked if she expected ''Showgirls'' to produce such a cult legacy, Riffel replied, &quot;No. I went into it thinking it would be a really erotic, serious, shocking exposé. People would be sitting on the edge of their seats from suspense. [... But] some people were trying to play straight comedy – I played my character with comedy;  I was hoping to get a laugh – but no one was acting with [[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue in cheek]]. I know that everyone went into it thinking it would be like ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. [...] Maybe it's Verhoeven. Even [''Basic Instinct''] seems kind of campy now [...] I think it's something with European filmmakers. I think – and this is my theory – [...] that there's something that European filmmakers have, a punched-up, extreme vibe. Everything's extreme.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondocelluloid.com/blog.php?p=254 |title=Interview: Rena Riffel Talks to Mondo Celluloid – Part 1 |publisher=Mondo Celluloid |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also quoted as saying, &quot;''Showgirls'' just keeps getting more and more popular, it's a total phenomenon.  I don't think a film could even try to have this afterlife happen to it. This cult status and celebration is all created by the fans and the people who saw something special in the film. I seem to be one of the only actors that represents and gets involved with the cult status. I think Elizabeth (Berkley) is still upset about how the film was received initially. I think she is brilliant in her role and she should have won best actress at some film festivals, and I think Joe Eszterhas's writing is remarkably brilliant. I suspect because the way they marketed the film, that is what led to the backlash. The marketing campaign was misleading. But at the end of the day, it all worked out for the best.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eatmybrains.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatmybrains.com/showfeature.php?id=92 |title=Interview with Dark Reel star Rena Riffel - Feature Article |publisher=Eat My Brains! |date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s July 23, 2010 issue announced a sequel to ''Showgirls''. Rena Riffel wrote, directed, and starred in the film, released in 2011. Initially entitled ''Showgirl'', it was later renamed ''[[Showgirls 2: Penny's from Heaven]]''.

==''Striptease''==

Following her role in ''Showgirls'', Riffel was cast in ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' with [[Demi Moore]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. ''Showgirls'' was generally disliked and the filmmakers feared people would pre-judge ''Striptease'' for that reason. To avoid any association between the two films, advèrtisements projected ''Striptease'' as more comedic than ''Showgirls'', which had been marketed as a drama.  Aside from a common context, ''Striptease'' and ''Showgirls'' shared two notable connections:  [[Marguerite Derricks]] choreographed both films, and Rena Riffel played a prominent role in each.

Widely considered a box office failure, ''Striptease'' lacked the momentum that ''Showgirls'' gained in its cult status and has subsequently been referred to as one of the [[worst movies ever made]].

==''Mulholland Drive''==

In 2001, Riffel appeared in the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.  When interviewed about the film and if she “got it”, Riffel replied, “See…I can’t remember.  No, I guess it still doesn’t make sense to me.  It’s been a while – I’d like to watch it again….one website put a lot of clarity on it with their theories.”&lt;ref name=&quot;mondocelluloid.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Connie Lynn says |url=http://www.mondocelluloid.com/blog.php?p=256 |title=Interview: Rena Riffel talks to Mondo Celluloid – Part 2 |publisher=Mondo Celluloid |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Czechsploitation, erotica and horror==

After ''Striptease'', Riffel accepted minor roles on the television series ''[[Married... with Children]]'' in 1997, and ''[[Clueless (TV series)|Clueless]]'' as well as the [[HBO]] movie ''[[Breast Men]]'' before making a string of films with European director Lloyd Simandl.  These movies, referred to by some{{Who|date=December 2009}} as “Czechsploitation” films, include ''Dark Confessions'', ''Bound Cargo'', ''Caligula’s Spawn'', and ''No Escape''.  These films, coupled with Riffel’s roles in ''Showgirls'' and ''Striptease'' opened the door for her to be cast in a handful of erotic/thriller films such as ''The Pornographer'' and ''Scandalous Behavior'' (with [[Shannon Tweed]]).

In 1999, Riffel appeared in ''[[Citizens of Perpetual Indulgence]]'', a gay-themed comedy/drama/art film.
Riffel also appeared in several horror/thriller movies including ''[[Candyman 3: Day of the Dead]]'', ''Unstable Minds'', and ''Dark Reel'' starring Edward Furlong and Tony Todd.

==Musical work and other projects==
According to the text trivia track on the 2010 Blu-ray release of ''Showgirls'', one of the songs played during the film's lap-dance sequence was co-written by Riffel.

In 2004, Riffel’s song &quot;Geisha Girl&quot; was featured in Oliver Robbins film ''Wild Roomies''. She also sang the theme song for 2007 E! Entertainment's series, ''Billionaire Heiresses'', called &quot;Livin' in the Fast Lane&quot;. In 2008, she starred in [[Coheed and Cambria]]'s music video for &quot;Feathers&quot; playing the 1950s character, Judy Feathers. Judy Feathers is the perfect housewife with a secret of being a cannibal, killing then serving the milkman, postman, sailor, and a boyscout for dinner. It won Best Video in 2008 in the UK for the Kerrang! Awards and Rena appeared on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' on March 5, 2008 with the band.

In 2008, Riffel directed, produced, wrote, and starred in the movie ''Trasharella'', a comedy/crime/fantasy musical. She edited the film herself and her production company, Rena Riffel Films, released the film on DVD through Amazon.com in 2009.

When asked to describe ''Trasharella'', Riffel stated, &quot;It is a satire on B-movie horror films... I went against the grain and instead of trying to make this slick Hollywood film, I just let things be as they were and made it into a really bad grindhouse style exploitation film. ...it's not a dumb film, it's just 'bad'... in a good way. Mae West said: 'When I'm good I'm good, but when I'm bad I'm better.' And we use her quote in ''Trasharella''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eatmybrains.com&quot;/&gt;

Riffel developed a musical based on ''Showgirls'', titled ''[[Showgirls#Showgirls! The Musical|Showgirls! The Musical]]'' and also wrote and directed a sequel to ''Showgirls''. The film had its first screening in October 27, 2011, at the Laemmle Theatre's Sunset 5 in West Hollywood, California. It played to a packed house who enjoyed the epic, which had a duration of 2 hours and 24 minutes. The film, now titled ''[[Showgirls 2: Penny's from Heaven]]'' received favorable reviews, with references made to David Lynch's ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' by [[CraveOnline]].com and ''[[LA Weekly]]''. ''Showgirls 2: Penny's from Heaven'' was screened in arthouse theatres across the country and announced further surprise screenings on the movie website, ShowGirls2Movie.com.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;!-- links and references needed for those sources --&gt;

Riffel is featured on the [[Velvet Revolver]] album ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0726457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Vogt''' (14 May 1911 – 19 May 1992) was a German [[composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]].

== Career ==
Born in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], Vogt studied with [[Georg Schumann (composer)|Georg Schumann]] and [[Otto Frickhoeffer]] at the [[Akademie der Künste]] in Berlin from 1929 to 1934.&lt;ref name=p&gt;Prieberg, {{pp.|389|390}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934 he worked in [[Minden]] as a cellist, pianist and conductor.&lt;ref name=p/&gt; In 1935 he was appointed [[Kapellmeister]] at the [[Bielefeld Opera]] and in 1937 at the [[Landestheater Detmold]]. That same year he joined the [[Nazi Party]] (registration no. 5.653.178).&lt;ref name=p/&gt; From 1938 until 1944 he was Kapellmeister of the Stralsunder Theater, and then music director of [[Stralsund]], where he was also chairman of the Ministry of Arts.&lt;ref name=p/&gt; In 1944 he was drafted into the military and sent to the Russian front. He was taken prisoner of war in 1945 and did not return from the Sowjet Union until 1949.

In the postwar period Vogt lived first in 1949 as a freelance composer in [[Neckargemünd]].&lt;ref name=p/&gt; From 1951 to 1978 he led a composition class at the Musikhochschule in Mannheim-Heidelberg. In 1971 he was appointed professor.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, S. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his students was [[Barbara Heller]].

Vogt composed two [[opera]]s, ''[[Die Stadt hinter dem Strom (opera)|Die Stadt hinter dem Strom]]'' after the [[Die Stadt hinter dem Strom|novel]] of [[Hermann Kasack]] and ''Athenerkomödie'' (The Metropolitans) on a libretto by [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]] after a fragment of [[Menander]]. Vogt wrote a [[symphony]], two concertos for orchestra, two [[piano concerto]]s, a [[violin concerto]], a [[cello concerto]], ''Serenade und Tarantella'' for viola and chamber ensemble, [[chamber music]] and [[Lied]]er. His sacred music included a [[Requiem]], two chamber [[oratorio]]s, a [[cantata]], a [[Magnificat]], and other choral music. In particular he composed the [[Psalm 130|Psalm 129]], ''De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine'', for a seven-part mixed choir [[a cappella]] (1951),a [[Passion (music)|Passion music]] ''Ihr Töchter von Jerusalem, weinet nicht über mich'' in Latin and German for tenor, mixed choir and percussion (1973), and a [[Nunc dimittis|Canticum Simeonis]] for mixed choir and flute (1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.di-arezzo.co.uk/scores-of-Hans+Vogt-from-Suddeutscher.html?app=40 Scores of Hans Vogt from Suddeutscher (Bärenreiter)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808000656/http://www.di-arezzo.co.uk/scores-of-Hans+Vogt-from-Suddeutscher.html?app=40 |date=2016-08-08 }} di-arezzo.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogt's first opera, ''Die Stadt hinter dem Strom'', was originally written for radio and premiered on [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] and [[BBC Radio]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Opera (British magazine)|Opera]]|volume=8|page=393|number=1|author=George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|year=1957|author-link=George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogt later adapted the work for the stage, and as a live theatre piece the opera was first performed at the [[Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden]] in 1955 as part of the [[Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oeser&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;operone&quot;&gt;[http://www.operone.de/komponist/vogt.html Hans Vogt] operone.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Kasack: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OrOeZtaPhFoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=hans+vogt+kasack+wiesbaden+oper+die+stadt+hinter+dem+strom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PHwm8PJVNw&amp;sig=nbMduH3Bhw0va-nK21lVYJxH71w&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=JVfdTcD8OMyc-wazmKWqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw Rückblick auf mein Leben] {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his operas, Vogt collaborated personally with the librettists, Hermann Kasack (Die Stadt hinter dem Strom) and Christopher Middleton (The Metropolitans).  [[Erich Fried]], together with the composer, translated Middleton's English libretto into German.  In an obituary for the publisher and musicologist Fritz Oeser that Vogt authored, the composer recalled how, during rehearsals for Die Stadt hinter dem Strom, Oeser had requested him to come to Wiesbaden to change the Chorprolog (choral prologue), also that Oeser missed a climax in a certain scene in act 3 and promised to pay for a change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oeser&quot;&gt;Hans Vogt: [http://www.fritz-oeser.de/1982-vogt-wuerdigung-text.html Fritz Oeser], ''Musica 36'', volume 2, p. 194-196, 1982, on fritz-oeser.de {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kasack's libretto was published by [[Suhrkamp]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/stadt-hinter-dem-strom-oratorische-oper-in-drei-akten/oclc/14511105 Die Stadt hinter dem Strom; oratorische Oper in drei Akten] worldcat.org&lt;/ref&gt; Vogt's opera ''Athenerkomödie'' (The Metropolitans) was premiered at the [[National Theatre Mannheim|Nationaltheater Mannheim]] in 1964, he revised it in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;operone&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Middleton: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0483.1965.tb01236.x/full A Talk on Athenerkomödie] onlinelibrary.wiley.com 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogt composed secular vocal works inspired by poems of Hermann Kasack, [[Christopher Fry]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Gerard M. Hopkins]], [[Aesop's Fables]], poems of [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]], [[Gertrud Kolmar]], [[Horace]], [[Eduard Mörike]] and [[Gottfried Benn]]. Vogt's chamber music without keyboard includes a trio for flute, viola and harp (1951, revised 1989), a [[string trio]], four [[string quartet]]s, a [[string quintet]], a [[string sextet]], a [[string octet]], duos for violin and double bass, violin and cello, violin and viola, cello and double bass, and music for solo instruments. With keyboard, he composed works for piano solo, piano four hands, two pianos, a [[quintet]] for flute, oboe, violin, bassoon and harpsichord (1958), ''Konzertante Sonate für 17 Soloinstrumente'', a sonata concertante for 17 solo instruments (1959), ''Dialoge für Klavier, Violine und Violoncello'' (dialogues for [[piano trio]], 1960), and works with piano for solo instruments cello, violin and oboe.

Vogt's music was published by [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], [[Bärenreiter]], and [[Bote &amp; Bock]]. He also published books, ''Neue Musik seit 1945'' (New Music since 1945), {{ISBN|3-15-010203-0}}, and ''Johann Sebastian Bachs Kammermusik: Voraussetzungen, Analysen, Einzelwerke'' (Johann Sebastian Bach's chamber Music: background, analysis, works), Stuttgart 1981, {{ISBN|3-15-010298-7}}. The latter was translated to English and published in [[Portland, Oregon]], in 1988, {{ISBN|0-931340-04-7}}, and to Spanish, published in [[Barcelona]] in 1993, {{ISBN|84-335-7880-4}}.

Vogt died in [[Metterich]] in 1992 at the age of 81.

'''Adriane Garcia''' (September 19, 1983) is a Brazilian TV presenter, actress and former pop singer-songwriter. She has lived in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] since 2005.

==Career==
Since she was a child, Adriane Garcia has always been passionate about music. At 14 she began a career as a model, but it was only years later that her life changed. After she had some interests in soap operas and mini-TV-series, Adriane was a reporter at [[SporTV]] in Brazil. In 2002 she joined [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]] reality show ''Casa dos Artistas 3''. Adriane was chosen to live in the house, where she stayed for 45 days. Her obvious interest in pursuing a career in music, Adriane was probed by Building Records&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingrecords.com.br/?/artista/perfil/20362 Profile Adriane Garcia on Building Records webpage] retrieved May 12, 2012 (pt)&lt;/ref&gt; to record some demo songs. As a result, the label approved her work and the same year Adriane began recording her first album.

Later Garcia took part in the third session of the Brazilian reality show ''Casa dos Artistas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.br/exclusivo/noticias/2002/10/16/017.htm|title=Mion ataca de DJ e Fabiana Saba aparece acompanhada em festa|date=October 16, 2002|work=[[ISTOÉ]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then released her debut album, ''Vem Ficar Comigo'', in early 2004. In 2007 she was chosen as the presenter for the [[Rede Record|Record Internacional]]'s TV show ''Sucesso'', in Portugal.

As the first Brazilian at all she is working now as TV Presenter for [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]]. In April 2012 she posed for fashion magazine [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magxone.com/maxim/adriane-garcia-maxim-portugal-april-2012/ Adriane Garcia Maxim Portugal April 2012] retrieved April 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anca Parghel''' (September 16, 1957– December 5, 2008) was a Romanian [[jazz]] singer, composer, arranger, pianist, choir conductor, and music teacher. As a jazz vocalist, she excelled in scat, vocal percussion, and improvisation. Her voice had a four octave range, this being one of the reasons she was compared to [[Yma Sumac]] in the Romanian music press. She had an exceptional ability to interpret songs in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese.

==Biography==
=== Early years ===

Born in [[Câmpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Suceava County]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]], to a poor family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viva.ro/Vedete/Articole-revista/Anca-Parghel-Nu-m-am-nascut-in-puf-Video.html?a=3842/357371+Interview+with+Anca+Parghel|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120915095413/http://www.viva.ro/Vedete/Articole-revista/Anca-Parghel-Nu-m-am-nascut-in-puf-Video.html?a=3842/357371+Interview+with+Anca+Parghel|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-15|language=Romanian |title=Nu m-am nascut in puf}}&lt;/ref&gt; she began singing at the age of three and performed onstage as a prodigy child. She also sang in the local church choir.

She left home at age 14 to enroll at the Music High School in [[Iaşi]]. Anca Parghel attended the Iaşi Music Conservatory, from which she graduated in 1981, having as primary instrument piano, and secondary [[bel canto]]. However, since jazz was not exactly popular nor officially encouraged in this part of the world living behind the [[Iron Curtain]], she studied jazz on her own from tapes and vinyl albums that were hard to find. At the age of 18, she married painter Virgiliu Parghel (divorced 2001), with whom she had two sons, Ciprian and Tudor, who became jazz musicians themselves.

===Teaching===
Anca Parghel taught music in [[Suceava]] ([[Bucovina]], Northern part of Romania) at the local Arts high-school before turning to a professional singing career (c. 1988–1989). She lived in [[Bucharest]] in the first part of the 1990s, before moving to Brussels in 1997. She was a professor of vocal jazz at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels|Royal Conservatory]] in [[Brussels]] and the [[Lemmensinstituut|Lemmens Institute]] in [[Leuven]] (1997–2002). She lived in Brussels for eight years before making a return to her home country around 2005. Her  Conservatory diploma dissertation work was about the improvisation of [[Charlie Parker]]. As a music instructor and choir conductor, she taught many generations of aspiring singers and professional musicians, and led many workshops across Europe in Bucharest, [[Chișinău]], Brussels, [[Namur]], in Germany and England.

===Performing===
She was a gifted jazz pianist and frequently played &quot;one-woman shows&quot; where she accompanied herself in the crooner's tradition. She composed her own jazz songs, including original poetical lyrics as in the ''Primal Sound'' album, and frequently arranged music for Big Band orchestras, frequently performing with the Romanian Big Band conducted by Ionel Tudor in Bucharest. She toured extensively in Europe, mostly playing in local jazz clubs in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.

She performed in Canada, most notably at the Rimouski Jazz Festival 2003 where she preceded and eclipsed famed French singer [[Anne Ducros]] (cf. Rimouski local press, in early September 2003 reporting on &quot;Rimouski Festi Jazz&quot;), and sporadically in the United States (2003–2006). She performed on-stage and recorded with well-known jazz performers such as [[Aldo Romano]], [[Archie Shepp]], [[Billy Hart]], [[Bruno Castellucci]], [[Charles Loos]], [[Claudio Roditi]], Decebal Badila, [[Eric Legnini]], Felix Simtaine, [[Gustavo Bergalli]], [[Hein van de Geyn]], [[Ivan Paduart]], Jean-Louis Rassinfosse, [[John Dankworth]], John Engels, [[John Ruocco]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Klaus Ignatzek]], [[Larry Coryell]], Marc Levine, Mark Griffith, [[Mircea Tiberian]], [[Norma Winstone]], [[Paolo Radoni]], [[Peter Herbolzheimer]], [[Peter Hertmans]], [[Philip Catherine]], [[Pierre Vaiana]], [[Pierre Van Dormael]], [[Riccardo Del Fra]], Rob Radna, Ron Van Rossum, [[Stéphane Galland]], Theo de Jong, [[Tomasz Stanko]], and the Romanian Radio Big-Band.

She made unannounced late night appearances at jazz clubs in New York City, where she played with the local bands led either by Pat Higgins at the &quot;Lennox Lounge&quot;, &quot;St. Nick's Pub&quot; or by Manny Duran at [[Cleopatra's Needle (New York City)|Cleopatra's Needle]]. Her concert in [[Danville, Virginia]], at the North Theater on November 10, 2006, was played to an enchanted full house and created a local sensation (cf. Danville, Virginia press).

Anca Parghel recorded an electro-pop album in 2007, and submitted the tune &quot;Brasil&quot; to National Selection Contest 2008 for Eurovision. The song was not selected, but &quot;Brasil&quot; gained commercial success in Romania and in Europe.

Anca Parghel died in [[Timișoara]] from late complications of breast cancer. She appeared on stage one month prior to her passing. She was buried on the &quot;Artists' Alley&quot; at [[Bellu Cemetery]] in Bucharest, not far from Romanian artists [[Maria Tănase]], [[Florian Pittiș]], and [[Adrian Pintea]].

{{nihongo|'''Yū Aku'''|阿久 悠|Aku Yū}} (occasionally credited as '''You Aku''') (February 7, 1937 – August 1, 2007), was a Japanese [[lyricist]], [[poet]], and [[novelist]].

== Early life ==
Yū Aku was born as Hiroyuki Fukada (深田公之, Fukada Hiroyuki) in [[Awaji Island]], [[Hyogo prefecture|Hyogo]], Japan. His parents both originated from the town of [[Kawaminami]] in [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], Kyūshū, Japan. His father worked as a police constable in Hyogo prefecture. His father's career necessitated moving every few years, resulting in Aku attending three separate junior high schools. Yū Aku graduated from [[Meiji University]]. 
== Career ==

Originally, Yū Aku desired to screenwrite  for movies, specifically the up-and-coming [[Moonlight Mask]] series. Aku started his career in advertisement production, which provided the foundation for his work as a lyricist. Aku worked on commercial production from 1959 to 1966. In 1964, he also took up broadcast writing. After his 1966 retirement from advertising, he continued to work as a broadcast writer and also as a lyricist. His first published work as a lyricist was the 1965 song 'Monkey Dance.' 
  
Yū Aku was famous for contributing lyrics to many recording artists since 1967. He was a prolific lyricist, writing more than 5,000 songs. Mainly during the 1970s, more than 20 of them reached #1 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] chart, and seven singles sold more than a million copies. Over 500 of his compositions which were released as singles have entered the Japanese record chart, and they sold in excess of 68 million copies from 1968 to 2007, making him the most commercially successful Japanese lyricist up to that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOobituary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/46870/|title=Yu Aku, one of the most notable lyricists in the 20th century died|language=ja|work=oricon.co.jp|publisher=[[Original Confidence]]|access-date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, total sales of the singles he has written exceed 68.3 million copies, making him the second best-selling lyricist in Japan behind only [[Yasushi Akimoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=【オリコン】秋元康氏、作詞シングル総売上が1億枚突破「34年間の積み重ね」| url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2063602/full/| work=[[Oricon]]| language=ja| date=2015-12-09| access-date=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he wrote the lyrics to The [[TV Asahi]] Song for the occasion of the television channel’s name change to its current name.

Throughout his 40-year career as a lyricist, Aku won the Japan Record Award five times. He was also acclaimed as a novelist, and produced several award-winning works. In 1999, Aku received [[Medals of Honour (Japan)|the Purple Ribboned Medal of Honor]] from the [[Government of Japan]], in honor of his long-term contributions to the Japanese entertainment industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSobituary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/f-et-tp0-20070801-235472.html|title=Yu Aku , aged 70, died of ureter cancer|language=ja|work=nikkansports.com|publisher=[[Nikkan Sports]]|access-date=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2001, Aku underwent surgery to remove his [[kidney cancer]]. He continued to work while undergoing chemotherapy until he died of [[ureteral cancer]] on August 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSobituary&quot;/&gt;

'''Lionel Neykov''' is a French songwriter and singer.

He became very popular in Spain during Christmas 2008 after his song ''Freeze my senses'' was selected for the annual advertising campaign of the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].

==Biography==
Born to a French mother and a Bulgarian father in Paris, he started playing the guitar when he was 21 years old. He soon started to write and record his own songs.
At the age of 24, he moved to New York, where he currently lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latino.myspace.com/lionelneykovstreetteam Lionel Neykov Street Team Fan Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144212/http://latino.myspace.com/lionelneykovstreetteam |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summer 2007 he started working on his first album; ''Songs of Want and Loss''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/lionelneykov Lionel Neykov page on MySpace]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}
After releasing his songs on YouTube and [[MySpace]], his song ''Freeze my senses'' was selected by the [[Advertising agency]] &quot;[[Ricardo Pérez Asociados]]&quot; for the television advertisement they were preparing for the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]] campaign for 2008. When &quot;Ricardo Pérez Asociados&quot; was selected by the Spanish Lottery to produce the commercials, he was contacted again and got a US$20,000 deal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.es/ciudadanos/loterianavidad/20081203/NWS-0609-lionel-neykov-cancion-loteria-navidad.html ADN newspaper, December 3rd 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206050358/http://www.adn.es/ciudadanos/loterianavidad/20081203/NWS-0609-lionel-neykov-cancion-loteria-navidad.html |date=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the use of his song on the advertisement, twice what he was offered initially.

'''Maurice Arnold Strothotte''' (19 January 1865, [[St. Louis, Missouri]] – 23 October 1937, [[New York City, New York]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians (8th Ed.) |last=Slonimsky |first=Nicolas |year=1992 |publisher=Schirmer Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[composer]] and [[performer]].

==History==
Maurice Arnold Strothotte was born in [[St Louis, Missouri]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Famous American Composers |last=Hughes |first=Rupert |year=1900 |publisher=L.C. Page |pages=[https://archive.org/details/famousamericanco00hugh/page/135 135] |url=https://archive.org/details/famousamericanco00hugh |quote=Maurice Arnold Strothotte. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later shortened his name to Maurice Arnold. Arnold's father was a physician and his mother a prominent pianist and his first teacher. At the age of fifteen he went to Cincinnati, Ohio studying at the College of Music for three years. In 1883 he traveled to Germany to study counterpoint and composition with [[Georg Vierling]] and [[Heinrich Urban]] in Berlin. Mr. Urban attempted to discourage him when Arnold began to incorporate African-American &quot;plantation&quot; dance elements into his music.

Following studies in Berlin Arnold went on a tour of Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey. Some of his compositions show the influence of his travels through those countries. Upon returning to Germany he then entered the Cologne Conservatory of Music where his first piano sonata was written and performed. He next went to Breslau, where, under the instruction of [[Max Bruch]], he wrote one of his first major works, his cantata &quot;The Wild Chase.&quot; Returning to Saint Louis he busied himself as a solo violinist and teacher, traveling also as an opera conductor.

Maurice Arnold was one of many African-American students of [[Antonín Dvořák]] during the Bohemian composer's stay in the United States as director of the newly formed [[National Conservatory of Music of America]] in New York (1892–1895). Arnold participated in Dvořák's famous January 23, 1894 concert about which the New York Herald wrote &quot;It was a remarkable event. Each soloist with one exception belong to the colored race. Bodies had been liberated but the gates of the artistic world were still locked. (Conservatory founder) [[Jeannette Thurber]]'s efforts in this effort were ably seconded by Dr. Dvořák.&quot; And while the program included Arnold's four &quot;American Plantation Dances&quot; the main attraction of the evening was Dvořák's arrangement of [[Stephen Foster]]'s &quot;The Old Folks at Home&quot; for chorus and orchestra. Arnold's four-movement suite, &quot;Plantation Dances.&quot; Op. 32, was thereafter performed with some regularity and was published for full orchestra as well as in an arrangement for piano duet in the United States and in Germany.

Arnold also wrote a work entitled &quot;Dramatic Overture&quot; and two comic operas. His &quot;Valse Elegante&quot; for two pianos, eight hands is composed in a charming salon style typical of the time and easily performed with a quartet of amateur pianists. Arnold also wrote a fugue for two pianos, eight hands, a &quot;Minstrel Serenade&quot; for violin and piano, and six duets for violin and viola. Among his many vocal works the most remarkable is his setting of the poem, &quot;I Think of Thee in Silent Night.&quot; Arnold also wrote works for ballet, a tarantella for string orchestra, and a symphony (unpublished). He was also the author of the textbook &quot;Some Points in Modern Orchestration.&quot;

But it is as a student at the then newly formed National Conservatory of Music in New York City and his association with the conservatory's director Antonín Dvořák for which Maurice Arnold is most remembered. Dvořák was extremely encouraging to the young Arnold at a time when Dvořák's philosophy of American nationalism in music was ridiculed by many of the musical establishment in New England. Even [[Edward MacDowell]], the dean of American composers of his day, wrote &quot;In spite of Dvořák's efforts to dress up American music in Negro clothing, it is my opinion that foreign artistry should have no place in our music, if it is to be worth of our free country.&quot; Crusading against the &quot;social sanctification of the arts&quot; popular in certain circles of the day Dvořák stated in the New York Herald (May, 1893) &quot;I am now convinced that the future music of this country must be built on the foundations of the song which are called Negro melodies. They must become the basis of a serious and original school of composition which should be established in the United States of America.&quot;

Dvořák's students were represented in full force at the [[Carnegie Hall]] premiere of his [[Symphony]] &quot;[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|From the New World]]&quot; on December 16, 1893. Dvořák, his wife, and their two sons, sat in a box of honor with Maurice Arnold, as the student composer for whom Dvořák had the highest hopes. Also in attendance was the great African American composer, singer and writer [[Harry Burleigh]]. The English horn solo in the second movement Largo made a lasting impression on Maurice Arnold and his fellow composition students, [[Harvey Worthington Loomis]], [[William Arms Fisher]], and [[Will Marion Cook]]. Dvořák had described the slow movement as &quot;a study or sketch for a longer work, either a cantata or an opera based on Longfellow's 'Hiawatha.'&quot; William Arms Fisher adapted the English horn melody using his own text &quot;Goin' Home&quot; that eventually established itself as a popular Negro &quot;[[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]].&quot; Arnold's version had the text &quot;Mother Mine.&quot; from M. Peress &quot;Dvořák to Duke Ellington&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The title page of the autograph score of Dvořák's ninth symphony.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The title page of the autograph score of Dvořák's ninth symphony, 1893]]

African American composers such as Maurice Arnold, Will Marion Cook and Harry Burleigh applied Dvořák's command of using Creole folk music, spirituals, plantation work songs, and popular music as a basis for the formation of a new American nationalist musical sound. [[Clara Gottschalk Peterson|Clara Gottschalk]] (the pianist, composer [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]]'s sister) wrote in the preface to her 1902 arrangements of &quot;Creole songs,&quot; &quot;if as Dr. Dvořák has claimed there is in time to be a native school of American music based on the primitive musical utterances of the red man and the black man these negro melodies are historical documents of some interest.&quot;

While Maurice Arnold did not become the main musical proponent of Dvořák's philosophy for a new American sound in music he did live long enough to see much of what Dvořák fought for come to pass; the birth of the blues, ragtime, jazz all leading to the first major African American composer [[William Grant Still]]. It was Still who finally did utilize the spiritual as a basis for one of the first important and original works for orchestra written by an African American, his &quot;[[Afro-American Symphony]]&quot; composed in 1930, seven years before Maurice Arnold's death in New York in 1937.

'''Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh''' ({{lang-fa|اسفندیار منفردزاده|Esfandiyār Monfaredzādeh}}; born 1941 in [[Tehran]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 27, 2012|title=A Tribute to Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh at Iranian Film Festival in San Francisco|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/12/aug/1228.html|access-date=2022-01-25|website=Payvand.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Iranian pioneer film composer, songwriter, and filmmaker. He is recognized for his contribution to film and [[Iranian pop music|pop music]] in Iran. His major works include [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']], ''Toughi'', ''[[Dash Akol]]'', ''[[Tangna]]'', [[The Deers (1974 film)|''The Deers'']] ''(Gavaznhā)''.

==Career==
=== Early years ===
He started his career early in his teens as percussionist and accordionist in the [[National Iranian Radio and Television|National Iranian Radio]] Children's Program. In 1958, he joined the Youth Orchestra of National Iranian Radio as contrabassist where shortly after he would be trusted with all the music arrangement and the conductor duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/fa-ir/%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D8%B4%D9%82-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7-%DA%AF%D9%BE%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%86%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87/a-3260605|title=&quot;کیمیایی بود، من و عشق سینما&quot; • گپی با اسفندیار منفردزاده {{!}} فرهنگ و هنر |date=2008-11-04|website=Deutsche Welle|language=fa|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
From his early ages, he was fascinated by cinema and filmmaking. This was the dream which he and his lifelong friend [[Masoud Kimiai]] (Iranian film director, screenwriter, and producer) shared. Finally, in 1967, when Masoud Kimiai got a chance to direct his first film (''Come Stranger'', 196, Monfaredzadeh composed the score. However, it was their second collaboration ([[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']], 1969) that made history. Months before ''Qeysar'' was released, he had left Iran to continue his studies in Germany where he had the opportunity to be acquainted with the [[Confederation of Iranian Students]] which helped him to reshape and deepen his social and political ideas. Hence, the [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] outbreak made him give up his studies and come back to Iran to pursue his cinematic career. The quality of his work in ''Qeysar'', along with the success of the film at the box office and among the critics, put more attention on the music for films in Iran which until that day was not taken seriously by the Iranian film industry. The following year, he won the Best Film Score award for [[Qeysar (film)|''Qeysar'']] at the second &quot;Sepas Awards&quot; ceremony which would be repeated the next year for his third collaboration with [[Masoud Kimiai]] (''Reza Motori'', 1970). His film scores continued with ''Toughi'' ([[Ali Hatami]], 1970), ''Window'' (Jalal Moghaddam, 1970), ''[[Dash Akol]]'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1971), ''Topoli'' (Reza Mirlohi, 1972), ''Balouch'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1972), ''Soil'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1973), ''[[Tangna]]'' ([[Amir Naderi]], 1973), and ''The Deers'' ''(Gavaznha)'' (Masoud Kimiai, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Displaced allegories : post-revolutionary Iranian cinema|last= Negar|first= Mottahedeh|date= 2008|publisher= Duke University Press|isbn= 9780822342755|location= Durham|oclc= 226361821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/closeupiranianci0000daba|title= Close up : Iranian cinema, past, present, and future|last= Dabashi|first=Hamid|date= 2001|publisher= Verso|isbn= 1859843328|location= London|oclc= 48432961|url-access= registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pop music ===
In 1965 and after working on the [[National Iranian Radio and Television|National Iranian Radio]] and later the [[University of Tehran]] orchestra, he began his collaboration with the Tanin Recording Studio (the first private recording studio in Iran), and along with his comrades he contributed to shape a new atmosphere in the [[Iranian pop music]]. In parallel to his cinematic activities and through his well-known songs such as &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;Nightly 1&quot;, he tried to represent Iranian people by picturing their pains and sorrows under the totalitarian Shah’s regime. In 1973, he was sentenced to jail for his social and political ideas. However, after his release he would not remain silent and with his works (songs such as &quot;Gonjishkak-e Ashi Mashi&quot;, &quot;Childish (Koudakaneh)&quot;, &quot;Nightly 2&quot; or &quot;Friday for Friday&quot;), he accompanied and supported people in the upcoming revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Iranian Music and Popular Entertainment: From Motrebi to Losanjelesi and Beyond|last= Breyley|first= G.

=== Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults ===
In 1970, he joined the “[[Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults]]&quot; where he contributed to establish the Children’s Film Training Center as well as writing music for audio books, animations, and short films produced by the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kanun-e-parvares-e-fekri-e-kudakan-va-nowjavanan|title=KĀNUN-E PARVAREŠ-E FEKRI-E Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exile ==
Shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution]] in February 1979, he concluded that this was not what he has wished for, so he expressed his concerns with the songs &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;. He decided to leave Iran and go to a self-imposed exile which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; During the exile, his artistic activities were extremely limited; however, he still believes in change for his country and his people.

'''Harris &quot;Harry&quot; Womack''' (June 25, 1945 – March 9, 1974) was an American singer and musician, most notable for his tenure as a member of the family R&amp;B quintet [[The Valentinos]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Harris &quot;Harry&quot; Womack grew up the fourth of five sons to Friendly and Naomi Womack in Cleveland's east side. The brothers were very close and they grew up affectionately attaching nicknames to one another— Harry's was &quot;Goat.” Raised as [[Baptist]], all five brothers began singing together when Harry was seven, forming '''The Womack Brothers'''. Like his brothers [[Bobby Womack|Bobby]] (1944–2014) and [[Cecil Womack|Cecil]] (1947–2013), Harry took up instruments, playing bass guitar before reaching his teenage years. Along with brothers Cecil and Curtis, Harry was a tenor vocalist while Bobby and Friendly, Jr. were baritones. In 1960, when he was fifteen, [[Sam Cooke]] signed the act to his [[SAR Records]] label, having told the brothers – and their father – that he was willing to work with them. Friendly Womack made Sam Cooke promise him that the brothers would continue to sing gospel and not what he referred to as &quot;the devil's music&quot;.

===Career===
Following two gospel releases with SAR, Sam Cooke suggested the group change their sound and name. In 1962, Cooke renamed them ''The Valentinos'' and produced and arranged the group's first major hit, &quot;[[Lookin' for a Love|Looking for a Love]]&quot;, which was led by Bobby. The record became a hit and landed them an opening spot on [[James Brown]]'s Revue. Following several modestly successful R&amp;B releases, the Valentinos' next hit, &quot;[[It's All Over Now]]&quot;, was released in 1964. While successful on the R&amp;B chart, the song became internationally successful after [[The Rolling Stones]] covered it and it has been covered by several bands hence.

Following Cooke's death at a L.A. motel in December 1964, SAR folded and Bobby Womack, now married to Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara, left the group for a solo career. The Valentinos briefly disbanded before regrouping as a quartet in 1966, signing with Chess Records where they recorded the Northern Soul hit, &quot;Sweeter than the Day Before&quot;. However, the group got dropped from Chess after only two singles and Cecil Womack followed Bobby out of the group after he married [[Mary Wells]]. In 1968, the remaining trio of Harry, Curtis and Friendly Jr. signed with Jubilee Records where they recorded the Cecil-composed &quot;Two Lovers History&quot; before being dropped in 1970.

In 1970, Harry started accompanying brother Bobby after Bobby began his successful solo career after several years in limbo due to the scandal surrounding his marriage to Barbara Cooke, playing bass in his band. He and the other Valentinos and Cecil Womack contributed background vocals to Bobby's solo records starting with the 1970 release, ''My Prescription''. Harry and the brothers were promptly featured in the background of Bobby's breakthrough hit, &quot;[[That's the Way I Feel About Cha]]&quot; as well as &quot;[[Woman's Gotta Have It]]&quot; from 1972. In late 1973, Harry and his brothers backed Bobby again on a remake of &quot;Lookin' for a Love&quot;. Prior to that, the Valentinos emerged with a minor R&amp;B hit of Bobby's &quot;I Can Understand It&quot;, its success landing them a performing spot on the hit dance show, ''[[Soul Train]]''.

Harry possessed an alluring, confident stage presence with the surprising ability to 'spark' a gig through &quot;seamless&quot; and flawless improvisation. He was very soft-spoken, warm &quot;natured&quot;, laid back and reflective, many times those qualities were mistaken for weakness, aloofness or lack of care and concern. He had a great sense of humor and quick wit, sharing it, off stage with choice few. Being quite reclusive, his preference, when not on tour, would be to kick back, relax with friends and treat his female pet snake (named Wo), who lived in the living room of his Pasadena home, in a rather sizable fish tank, to various delectable live treats. Harry seldom drove, preferring instead the accompaniment of the groups roadie/confidant &quot;Bill Crite&quot;, who always made himself available to the band members, on and off the road, their friendship was admirable.

1970 became an extremely busy year for the Womacks' - Bobby also squeezing in the recording of '''The Womack Live - Bobby Womack''' on the Liberty Label...Harry's strong bass line resounds throughout the album, but expressly can be heard in the cut, &quot;The Preacher/More Than I Can Stand&quot; which positioned #30 on Billboard R&amp;B Charts (which was later reissued 1989 on Charity R&amp;B) – the liner 'notes', written by their roadie Bill Crite, are as follows:  On Saturday night, in Hollywood – a monster was born! A living, breathing monster! On this night a recording was made. The artist? Bobby Womack! The monster? A collection of 9 songs, recorded live and in full color. Bobby held church that night and for all of those present, before they left, I know they felt the spirit moving into their bodies and rocking them with a whole lotta' soul. (Bill Crite). Although liner notes state the recording was made in Hollywood, it was actually recorded in the heart of Los Angeles in a small club called The Californian, now defunct, located, back then, on the N/E corner of St. Andrews Place and [[Santa Barbara Avenue]] (now Martin Luther King Blvd). While listening to the recording, there's a portion where Bobby's then manager, Ed Wright yells to Bobby, &quot;the police said we got to go – it's 10 after 2..&quot; (clubs were only licensed to stay open until 2am); and with Harry's bass still pulsing, Bobby didn't miss a beat, repeats the statement, then retorts, &quot; well tell the police to come on in!&quot; Womack attempted to wrap up, with Wright closing, &quot;Ladies and gentleman Bobby Womack, Bobby Womack&quot;, but the house wanted more, Bobby came back and gave them one more – the police just stood at the door...listening!

In 1972 Bobby released the album ''[[Understanding (Bobby Womack album)|Understanding]]''. The album reached No. 43 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop albums chart and No. 7 on the R&amp;B albums chart. One of the key songs from the album, &quot;[[I Can Understand It]]&quot;, has become a soul classic and was covered by  [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]] in '73 and became a major hit for them. Bobby later produced a cover version of the cut for his brothers [[The Valentinos]] - Harry, Curtis and Friendly, Jr. The brothers sang background on the '''original''' version. The '''album''' version of &quot;I Can Understand It&quot; became a huge club hit and had great cross over appeal.

Bobby later described his brother as &quot;bohemian&quot; and &quot;carefree&quot;. Though it was assumed that Bobby's 1973 hit, &quot;[[Harry Hippie]]&quot;, was about him, Bobby later said that it was just a song given to him by his collaborator and friend, country singer-songwriter [[Jim Ford]]. Nonetheless, during performances of the song, Harry would do dance numbers, which caused laughter among audience members and Bobby himself. Harry's last professional recording was singing background (tenor) on Bobby's album, ''[[Lookin' for a Love Again]]'', released in January 1974. The title track would find success for a third time after its release.

===Death===
Noting continuing escalation of relational problems between Harry &amp; his girlfriend, Patricia,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=March 28, 1974|title=Singer's Brother Is Buried After Stabbing By Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t48DAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=bobby+womack+scholarship&amp;pg=PA52|magazine=Jet|volume=46|issue=1|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby suggested, instead of touring, Harry stay behind, at his home for &quot;a time-out&quot; while he and the rest of the band went on the road to promote his new album. On the night of March 9, 1974, shortly after arriving at Bobby's; Patricia started an argument with Harry, claiming she'd found a pair of panties in the room he was occupying in Bobby's home; engulfed in rage, fueled by jealousy, Patricia grabbed a steak knife, plunging it into Harry's neck, mortally &quot;wounding&quot; him; the violent act, left her 7-year-old son, (from a previous union) that Harry cared for during their 6-year relationship and their 3-year-old daughter parentless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It was a case of jealousy,&quot; said Bobby, adding that &quot;she thought he was leaving.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The undergarments later turned out to belong to a girlfriend of Bobby's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2696322/bobby-womack-sam-cooke/|title=Bobby Womack and His Brothers Found Love in Familiar Places|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)]].

The tune &quot;Harry Hippie&quot; penned in 1972 by Jimmy Ford for Bobby; although not written in reference to Harry, Bobby performed it as a tribute to Harry, for over 4 decades, until the day of his death in 2014. Bobby further expounded on his brother's death in an interview quote about the song and in ''[[Understanding (Bobby Womack album)|Understanding]]'' wiki article under the Harry Hippie section. A week after Harry's death, his last recording as a background vocalist, on his brother's record &quot;Lookin' for a Love&quot;, reached number-one on the R&amp;B chart and number ten on the pop chart, later selling two million copies.

==Casino==
The band were signed to [[Polydor Records]] in 2006 and changed their name to SpiderSimpson, after a character from a cult film. They recorded what was then going to be their debut album at Studio 606 in Los Angeles with record producer [[Nick Raskulinecz]]. The band were not happy with the original track order of the album, and saw the recording rejected by Polydor.

In the autumn 2006 they completed the Kerrang! Radio Breakthrough Tour with other newly signed bands, followed by a UK tour in December. But in 2007, Zindani became involved with touring with Stereophonics as their live guitarist. Then in 2008, the future of Casino was put in doubt when Zindani was made a permanent member of Stereophonics. In May 2011 Adam announced on Kerrang! Radio that the band signed a record deal and they were going to release an album. This turned out to be 2009s “The Spider Simpson Incident” and was a re-recording of their rejected album, with added new songs. Since then they have done several gigs in Birmingham and London in between Stereophonics gigs. In late 2012 two singles were released, 'Runaway' and 'Rise and Fall', followed by the release of album 'Heavy Fever'.

==Stereophonics==
On 20 May 2007, at [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Big Weekend in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], Zindani joined Stereophonics on stage. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the Pull the Pin tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He was credited for writing and performing on two of the band's tracks, &quot;You're My Star&quot; and &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;. On &quot;You're My Star&quot;, he sang backing vocals and played lead guitar, whereas, on &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;, he only played lead guitar. He was made an official member of the band leaving the future of Casino hanging in the balance. Casino's debut album was funded by the money Zindani made touring with Stereophonics.

With the group he has recorded the albums ''[[Keep Calm and Carry On (album)|Keep Calm and Carry On]]'' in 2009, ''[[Graffiti on the Train]]'' in 2013, ''[[Keep the Village Alive]]'' in 2015, ''[[Scream Above the Sounds]]'' in 2017, [[Kind (album)|Kind]] in 2019 and Oochya in 2022.

==Personal life==
Zindani still lives in Birmingham, while other members of Stereophonics have all moved to London. Not much is known of his personal life but in Stereophonics interviews he has mentioned his children. He has also appeared on ''Soccer AM'' with fellow Stereophonics member [[Kelly Jones]].

Adam is a [[Birmingham City F.C]] fan. Adam attended St Bernard's Roman Catholic Primary School in Moseley before moving to Kings Heath and entering [[The Baverstock Academy|Baverstock School]], Druids Heath, Birmingham.
